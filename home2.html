<P>

<B><U>Doggy Potty Bag Dispensers</U> - </B> The PRA maintains 6 litter bag dispensers in Parkwood: one at the park entrance at Saul and Parkwood, two on the KP Elementary playground (one at each backstop), one at the intersection of Wildwood and Dresden, one at the intersection of Wildwood and Parkwood Drive, and one at the easement entrance on Edgefield Road.  If you notice that a dispenser is empty, please <a href="mailto:parkwoodresidents@yahoogroups.com">send an email with the dispenser location to the listserve</a>.

<P>

<B><U>Pets - <I>It's the Law: Dogs must be leashed at all times</I></U></B> when off the owner’s property (unless in a designated dog exercise area). And please pick up after your pet. That's also required by law - and it helps keep our community pleasant and our neighbors happy. <!-- <A HREF="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/poltmpl.asp?url=/Content/POL/ask/animal/summarylaws.asp">The law</A>. -->

Dial 311 to request County mowing in common areas in hope that volumes of calls will sway the County to send mowers to our community sooner rather than later.  Thanks for your help in making our voices and needs heard.  <I>The PRA Beautification Committee</I>

 <A HREF="search.html" target="_self"><B>Search the entire Parkwood web site</B></A>
This includes old newsletters, meeting minutes, letters sent by the PRA, bylaws, etc.

<P>
<B><U>Police Liaison</U> - </B>The community police liaison for Parkwood is Officer Oliver Janney. Officer Janney can be reached at <A HREF="mailto:oliver.janney@montgomerycountymd.gov">oliver.janney@montgomerycountymd.gov</A>, or by phone at 301 657-0962. Officer Janney

<P>
<B><U>LOCK YOUR CAR</U> -</B> There have been a number of thefts from cars, mostly from <B>unlocked</B> cars.
<P>
<B><U>Reporting Vandalism</U> - </B>
EVERY vandalism incident should be reported to the Police non-emergency number, <B>301-279-8000</B>, or via the online form at
<A HREF="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/poltmpl.asp?url=/content/pol/coplogic/cologic.asp">http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/poltmpl.asp?url=/content/pol/coplogic/cologic.asp</A>.
Making a report is necessary so that it gets into the police's crime database, so that it gets tracked by time/region/nature, and so that it ultimately affects resource allocation. If you call, you give them your name, address, and phone number, and they typically have someone call you back to take the report over the phone within 24 hours.
<P>
<B><U>Incidents of Interest to Police</U> - </B>It is important to call the police non-emergency number (<B>301 279-8000</B>) when neighbors believe their doors are being tried, homes are being cased, etc.  This number should be called when the incident occurs. Or fill out the online form (next paragraph).
<P>
<B><U>Montgomery County Maryland Police Department On-line Citizen Reporting System (<I>CRS</I>)</U> - </B>
<I>CRS</I> is designed to make it easier and more convenient to file a police report without leaving home. Not every crime can be reported this way, but you may report theft, vandalism, identity theft, and lost property using the CRS online form.  Here is the Web site:

<B><I>Membership:</I></B></FONT></A>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><U>Membership</U></B> in the Parkwood Residents Association (PRA) is open to all residents of the Parkwood neighborhood located in Bethesda and Kensington, Maryland (<a href="map.html">Map</a>). Annual dues are just $10 per household and are put toward community activities and expenses, including printing costs associated with the newsletter and costs of maintaining the PRA listserve.  The PRA funds support five gardens in Parkwood and six doggy potty bag dispensers and in past years have paid for the Parkwood entrance signs and a garden bench.  Additional contributions to help the Beautification Committee clean and maintain the Parkwood islands are encouraged.
Thank you.

<p>If you have not already submitted your dues for this year ($10), please send a check made out to PRA to:</p>

<p>
You can print out a membership form <A HREF="docs/pra-membership-form-2017.docx">here</A>.
</p>

<p>
Or, simply click on the button below to pay on the PayPal website. You can use this even if you don't have a PayPal account, as long as you have one of the credit cards shown. This year the PRA plans to make available on our website a list of PRA members who have paid their dues, with their addresses and email addresses.  This list will ONLY be distributed on the PRA listserv, which is limited to Parkwood residents.  Also it will be in PDF format to make it difficult to use as an email distribution list.  In past years, many members have forgotten if they paid or not, and this will give people a way to look it up. </p>

<p>

If you are paying by PayPal and don't want your name included on our list of PRA members please note this on the PayPal website where it says "add specific instructions to the seller" or email PRA treasurer Gerald Sharp at <a href="mailto:gbs2001@yahoo.com">gbs2001@yahoo.com</a> to let him know that you want to be listed as anonymous.
