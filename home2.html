year!<br>
<img src="PRAMemberFlyer.png"></i></b></p>
<p id="membership-detail"><b><i><b><u>Membership</u></b> in the
Parkwood Residents Association (PRA) is open to all residents of
the Parkwood neighborhood located in Bethesda and Kensington,
Maryland (<a href="map.html">Map</a>). Annual dues are just $10 per
household and are put toward community activities and expenses,
including printing costs associated with the newsletter and costs
of maintaining the PRA listserve. The PRA funds support five
gardens in Parkwood and six doggy potty bag dispensers and in past
years have paid for the Parkwood entrance signs and a garden bench.
Additional contributions to help the Beautification Committee clean
and maintain the Parkwood islands are encouraged. Thank
you.</i></b></p>
<p><b>If you have not already submitted your dues for this year
($10), please send a check made out to PRA to:</b></p>

<p><b>You can print out a membership form <a href=
"docs/membership-form-2018.docx">here</a>.</b></p>
<p><b>Or, simply click on the button below to pay on the PayPal
website. You can use this even if you don't have a PayPal account,
as long as you have one of the credit cards shown. This year the
PRA plans to make available on our website a list of PRA members
who have paid their dues, with their addresses and email addresses.
This list will ONLY be distributed on the PRA listserv, which is
limited to Parkwood residents. Also it will be in PDF format to
make it difficult to use as an email distribution list. In past
years, many members have forgotten if they paid or not, and this
will give people a way to look it up.</b></p>
<p><b>If you are paying by PayPal and don't want your name included
on our list of PRA members please note this on the PayPal website
where it says "add specific instructions to the seller" or email
PRA treasurer Gerald Sharp at <a href=

</ul>
You can contact the Tree Committee at <a href=

<p><b><u>Doggy Potty Bag Dispensers</u> -</b> The PRA maintains 6
litter bag dispensers in Parkwood: one at the park entrance at Saul
and Parkwood, two on the KP Elementary playground (one at each
backstop), one at the intersection of Wildwood and Dresden, one at
the intersection of Wildwood and Parkwood Drive, and one at the
easement entrance on Edgefield Road. If you notice that a dispenser
is empty, please <a href=
"mailto:parkwoodresidents@yahoogroups.com">send an email with the
dispenser location to the listserve</a>.</p>
<p><b><u>Pets - <i>It's the Law: Dogs must be leashed at all
times</i></u></b> when off the owner&#8217;s property (unless in a
designated dog exercise area). And please pick up after your pet.
That's also required by law - and it helps keep our community
pleasant and our neighbors happy.</p>
<p><b><u>Dial 311 to request mowing of common areas</u> -</b> Help
keep Parkwood beautiful! Dial 311 to request County mowing in
common areas in hope that volumes of calls will sway the County to
send mowers to our community sooner rather than later. Thanks for
your help in making our voices and needs heard. <i>The PRA
Beautification Committee</i></p>
<p><a href="search.html" target="_self"><b>Search the entire
Parkwood web site</b></a> This includes old newsletters, meeting
minutes, letters sent by the PRA, bylaws, etc.</p>
<p><b><u>Police Liaison</u> -</b> The community police liaison for
Parkwood is Officer Dana Stroman. Officer Stroman can be reached at
<a href=
"mailto:dana.stroman@montgomerycountmd.gov">dana.stroman@montgomerycountmd.gov</a>,
or by phone at 301 657-0962.</p>
<p><b><u>LOCK YOUR CAR</u> -</b> There have been a number of thefts
from cars, mostly from <b>unlocked</b> cars.</p>
<p><b><u>Reporting Vandalism</u> -</b> EVERY vandalism incident
should be reported to the Police non-emergency number,
<b>301-279-8000</b>, or via the online form at <a href=
"http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/poltmpl.asp?url=/content/pol/coplogic/cologic.asp">
http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/poltmpl.asp?url=/content/pol/coplogic/cologic.asp</a>.
Making a report is necessary so that it gets into the police's
crime database, so that it gets tracked by time/region/nature, and
so that it ultimately affects resource allocation. If you call, you
give them your name, address, and phone number, and they typically
have someone call you back to take the report over the phone within
24 hours.</p>
<p><b><u>Incidents of Interest to Police</u> -</b> It is important
to call the police non-emergency number (<b>301 279-8000</b>) when
neighbors believe their doors are being tried, homes are being
cased, etc. This number should be called when the incident occurs.
Or fill out the online form (next paragraph).</p>
<p><b><u>Montgomery County Maryland Police Department On-line
Citizen Reporting System (<i>CRS</i>)</u> -</b> <i>CRS</i> is
designed to make it easier and more convenient to file a police
report without leaving home. Not every crime can be reported this
way, but you may report theft, vandalism, identity theft, and lost
property using the CRS online form. Here is the Web site: <a href=
"http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/poltmpl.asp?url=/content/pol/coplogic/cologic.asp">
http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/poltmpl.asp?url=/content/pol/coplogic/cologic.asp</a>.</p>
<p><b><u>Power Outage Map</u></b> You can view a map of power
outages on Pepco's website (if you have an internet connection...):
<a href=
"http://www.pepco.com/home/emergency/maps/stormcenter/">www.pepco.com/home/emergency/maps/stormcenter/</a>.</p>
<p><b><u>Snow Plowing</u></b> County map showing which streets have
been plowed: <a href=
"http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/SnowMap">www.montgomerycountymd.gov/SnowMap</a>
You can report streets not plowed from that page also.<br></p>
<p><b><u>Have a New Neighbor?</u></b> Have you noticed ANY
newcomers to our neighborhood? We want to welcome our new neighbors
to Parkwood. A PRA welcome packet is being developed and Welcome
Committee Chair Randa Mostehy and PRA Block Captains will be
passing them out. If you would like to welcome a new neighbor or
have a packet dropped off, please contact Randa at 301-922-7490 or
