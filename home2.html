<B><U>Rock Creek Trail Renovation</U> - </B>
Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission and Montgomery County are improving Rock Creek Trail,
including the section through Parkwood. Lucas Bonney, Project Manager, gave a presentation at the Dec 9 PRA meeting.
<B>You can see the slides <A HREF="docs/Rock_Creek_Trail_Facility_Plan_141209.pdf" target="_blank">here</A></B> (6 MB download).
Note the changed alignment: the rebuilt trail will NOT run right next to Beach Drive, but has been moved away from the road.
Part of the trail, on the flood plain, will be a raised "boardwalk", hopefully concrete.
<P>
Previous plans are at
<A HREF="http://www.montgomeryparks.org/pdd/cip/rockcreek_trl_facility_plan.shtm"  target="_blank">www.montgomeryparks.org/pdd/cip/rockcreek_trl_facility_plan.shtm</A>.
A public meeting was held Nov 13, 2013, at which plans were presented and comments solicited.
Links to these documents are on the montgomeryparks page above. In particular, a map of the proposed realignment is
<A HREF="http://www.montgomeryparks.org/pdd/cip/documents/proposed_preliminary_trail_alignment.pdf" target="_blank">here</A>.
They were proposing that the rebuilt trail run right next to Beach Drive, most of the way from Cedar to Franklin, instead of near the creek where it is now.
That has been changed (see previous paragraph).

Making a report is necessary so that it gets into the police's crime database, so that it gets tracked by time/region/nature, and so that it ultimately affects resource allocation. If you call, you give them your name, address, and phone number, and they typically have someone call you back to take the report over the phone within 24 hours.
<P>
<B><U>Incidents of Interest to Police</U> - </B>It is important to call the police non-emergency number (<B>301 279-8000</B>) when neighbors believe their doors are being tried, homes are being cased, etc.  This number should be called when the incident occurs. Or fill out the online form (next paragraph).
<P>
<B><U>Montgomery County Maryland Police Department On-line Citizen Reporting System (<I>CRS</I>)</U> - </B>
<I>CRS</I> is designed to make it easier and more convenient to file a police report without leaving home. Not every crime can be reported this way, but you may report theft, vandalism, identity theft, and lost property using the CRS online form.  Here is the Web site:
