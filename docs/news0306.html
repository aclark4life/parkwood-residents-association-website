<B>Message from the President, Liz Brennan</B>
<P>
The Planning Board has indicated that modifications need to be made to the plans for the new
Kensington Safeway. There will be an informational meeting on the Safeway hosted by the Coalition of
Kensington Communities on Thursday, May 29th at 7:30 pm at the Garret Park Town Hall. All interested
Parkwood residents are encouraged to attend.
<P>
We are in need of a new volunteer to serve as the PRA representative on the NIH Community Liaison
Council. The Council meets on the 3rd Thursday of every month at 4 pm. The meetings usually last
about 2 hours. Parking fees are reimbursed. Contact Kirea Lueders
(<A HREF="mailto:kklarl@yahoo.com">kklarl@yahoo.com</A>,
301-496-6855 -
daytime #) for additional information or if you are able to serve. Current issues include the proposed
bioterrorism facility - we need to be at the table on these discussions.
<P>
This is a call to action for volunteers.  At this time it appears that we only have a few active committees
Block Captain and Gardening. I believe there is a lot of interest in other committees but not enough
leaders. I would very much like to revive the Traffic Committee and the Beltway Sound Barrier
Committee.  Please contact me if you are interested or if you know of someone I can approach.
<P>
<B>PRA to Host Speaker on Annual Growth Policy</B>
<P>
The Annual Growth Policy (AGP) is undergoing a "top to bottom" review by Park and Planning and the
County Council with the goal of ratifying changes in November of this year. Park and Planning has
scheduled a series of forums to gather input from the communities on the AGP.
<P>
The AGP is the policy that is intended to be an instrument that facilitates and coordinates the use of
various powers of government to limit or encourage growth and development in a manner that best
enhances the general health, welfare and safety of county residents. County officials use the AGP to
match the timing of private development with the availability of public facilities.
<P>
Based on the current gridlock on our roads and the overcrowded schools, it is probably safe to say that
the current AGP is not working.  As a friendly reminder to our elected officials at the County Council and
the appointed officials at the Planning Board that we are an engaged and active community, I would like
to have the Parkwood community weigh in on this issue. Karl Moritz, Research and Policy Planner for the
Planning Board has been invited to our June 9th meeting to provide information on the current draft
changes and how our community can participate in this important process.
<P>
<B>Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC)</B>
<P>
<B>Community Center:</B> Liz Brennan, Chair of the Community Center and Recreation Committee of the
Coalition of Kensington Communities testified in front of the State House Appropriations Committee in
Annapolis in March. Rich Madaleno, District 18 delegate, sponsored a $100,000 bond bill for planning
and design of a community center at the Housing Opportunities Commission site on Summit Ave.  Given
the grim financial picture at the state level, it's no surprise that the bill did not pass.  Nevertheless, this
opportunity was very good exposure for the cause. Committee members appeared to be very interested
in the fact that a location and building have been identified and they asked questions and offered advice
about going forward.  We look forward to continuing work with our state and county representatives
toward providing a community center for Kensington residents.
<P>
<B>Traffic:</B> The CKC testified in front of the Planning Board regarding Zoning Text Amendment (ZTA) 03-06
to eliminate the requirement for a traffic study at the zoning stage for a development. This ZTA was
specifically created to help the LCOR development at White Flint (8 buildings: 20 stories high, 4
apartment buildings, 4 office building, plus retail space) through the zoning approval process. The
argument given on behalf of the CKC is that more information is better than less and that requiring a
traffic study at the zoning stage and another at the site plan stage would ensure enough time to allocate
funding and allow community input. However, members of the Planning Board unanimously supported
the ZTA and, by a 5 to 2 vote, County Council did the same. As a result, we have no idea at this time
what the LCOR developers can do to effectively mitigate the traffic impact of their project.
<P>
<B>Development Impact Tax:</B> In May, Council members Tom Perez (District 5) and Phil Andrews (District
3) sponsored a bill to impose an impact tax on developers dedicated for school construction.
Montgomery County Schools are currently two years behind on a very conservative construction
schedule (so conservative that elementary schools are being modernized once every 125 years!).
Council member Perez authored a compelling editorial in the <I>Gazette</I> and support for this bill was broad-
based and countywide.  Some of the supporters included the Board of Education, Montgomery County
Council of PTAs, the Town of Gaithersburg, the Town of Rockville, Montgomery County Taxpayers
League, Montgomery County Education Association, NAACP, Solutions Not Sprawl, the Audubon
Naturalist Society, and many more. CKC was pleased to testify and fully supports this effort. However,
the proposal lost by a narrow margin in a contentious 5 to 4 vote. Those supporting the bill included
Marilyn Praisner (District 4)  and Michael Subin (at-large), as well as the sponsors.  This set-back may be
sorely felt by our community as funding for the KP modernization and the WJ modernization is at risk of
being delayed even further.

<P>
There are 912 houses in the PRA membership area, yet only about 125 of them are represented in the
association. Where are all of our neighbors? Surely they are interested in improving our safety, resolving
traffic issues, understanding property taxes, learning about local development, and — most of all —
meeting their neighbors.
<P>
Membership in PRA is an excellent way to stay informed about the things that affect us most directly and
to lend your voice to an organization that represents us to the larger community.
<P>
If you have not already submitted your dues for 2003 ($10), please complete the form below and send
your check to Kitty Stone, 4313 Clearbrook Lane, Kensington 20895. If you are not sure about your
membership status, please call Kitty at (301) 564-6340 or e-mail her at
<A HREF="mailto:castone3@aol.com">castone3@aol.com</A>.
<P>
For an energetic, useful, and effective neighborhood association, all of us must participate.

<P>
According to the Montgomery County Public Schools' projections, Kensington Parkwood Elementary
School is anticipating an additional 30 students in grades 1 through 5 next school year. The projected
2003-04 kindergarten enrollment is 70. Currently, fewer than 50 kindergarten students have enrolled for
the fall.
<P>
To ensure adequate staffing, school leadership is encouraging prospective families to register their
children as soon as possible. If you have any questions about the school or its programs, contact either
PTA President Laura Roberts at (301)493-4988 or Principal John Cechini at (301) 571-6949
<P>
<B>Garden Committee News</B>
<P>
The Garden Committee hired a local Kensington man, Derrick Brown, (301) 564-3662, to do the work on
the Saul Road island this year and we're very pleased with the results. He gathered the leaves and loads
of trash left by our neighbors, weeded, and mulched around the shrubs. It certainly is a big improvement
to have the island in good shape for the start of spring and summer. The cleanup makes it a lot easier for
volunteers to maintain the island throughout the summer.
<P>
Next, we would like to have some volunteers come forward to organize the "beautification" of the other
islands in Parkwood. Are any residents interested in working on the Wildwood and Roxbury islands?
Contact Jean Wirsching (301-493-8667) if you are able to help
<P>
Finally, let's all be good citizens about keeping the public green space and islands clean. Please don't
litter or discard your own garden waste on the islands. Please ask your neighbors not to "trash" the
islands. And please, please, it's a county ordinance to pick up your dog's waste.

In order to provide a constant source of communication for the Parkwood Community, an e-mail group
was created. The e-mail group is open to all residents of the Parkwood subdivision who have an e-mail
address. To subscribe to the e-mail group, send a blank message to:
<A HREF="mailto:parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</A>.
Do not write anything in the subject or body of the message; it will not be
seen by anyone and you will not get a response. You will receive a confirmation message when you are
subscribed. Many thanks to Heidi Lipson for setting up this valuable communication opportunity!

<B>PRA Bookclub</B>
<P>
Love books? Interested in getting to know your neighbors? The PRA bookclub meets once a month to
engage in lively conversations about books. If you are interested in participating, contact Karen Lockyer
at (301) 530-8311.
<P>
<B>Dog Leash Law Update</B>
<P>
Last fall the PRA passed a resolution requesting the Montgomery County Council require dogs to be on a
leash after one act of aggression: Our resolution was sent to the County Council members along with
similar PTA and CKC resolutions late last year. The Council Public Safety Committee, chaired by Council
member Phil Andrews, is now reviewing dog leash laws to determine if more protections are needed
against attacks. Our PRA resolution helped prompt this review..
<P><BR><BR>
<B>PRA Directory</B>
<P>
Work is continuing on the PRA directory, if you haven't already completed a form and either e-mailed or
mailed it to Kitty Stone, please do so as soon as possible.  We currently have received fewer than 100 forms.
<P>
This directory is similar to the directories that all schools and most churches provide to their members. It
can serve as an important communication tool for our neighborhood in many ways, including facilitating
outreach during bad weather, sharing information on local schools and daycare programs, setting up
play-dates for children, organizing block parties, yard sales, and other social events. Finally, it can serve
as a critically important outreach option if a situation arises.  It is very important for all to participate.
<P>
We have determined the pricing for the advertising and are giving first opportunity to Parkwood business folk. All
advertisers will be listed on an acknowledgement page in the front of the directory and then ads will be placed
through out the book.  The pricing breakdown is: Cover $150 ,  Full page $100, &frac12; page $ 75 and &frac14; page $ 50.
Contact Debbie Zwick if you are interested in purchasing advertising space
<A HREF="mailto:drzwick@yahoo.com">drzwick@yahoo.com</A> or 301-581-9392.
