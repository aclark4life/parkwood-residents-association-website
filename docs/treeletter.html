Dear Mr. Linkletter,
<P>
This letter serves as a follow-up to our conversation about County maintenance of trees in the Kensington neighborhood of Parkwood. The Parkwood Residents Association is a civic group representing the interests of the Parkwood area, which encompasses approximately 900 homes. Parkwood is bordered by Parkwood Drive on the west and south, by Cedar Lane on the east, and by Westbrook Lane on the north (see enclosed map).
<P>
We thought that tree maintenance would be expedited if we could present the problems identified by residents to the County as a single request. I was the person who collected the data, and these were presented to Guy Turenne in January of 2006 (spreadsheet enclosed). I have also enclosed copies of some e-mail correspondence I had with Mr. Turenne about the Parkwood trees, since it appears that all of our interactions with him have been lost as a result of his leaving.
<P>
From my conversation with you, it is clear that we are starting the process all over again. You mentioned that once you have received this official request from the Parkwood Residents Association, Parkwood will be put at the top of the list of neighborhoods for the block pruning program. We appreciate this, since nearly a year has passed with little action in spite of repeated assurances by Mr. Turenne and from Mr. Arthur Holmes, Director of DPWT that action was being taken.
<P>
Please let me know if you need additional information. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
<P>
Sincerely,<BR><BR><BR>


Kira K. Lueders<BR>
President, Parkwood Residents Association<BR>
