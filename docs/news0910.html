<B>LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Parkwood Residents,
<P align="justify">
Fall is upon us once again.  The light seems to fade a little more quickly.  The mornings become more brisk.  The challenges we all face as individuals, families and a community are as inexorable as our planet's path around the sun.  But as we are mere spectators to the changing seasons, we need not be to the issues facing Parkwood and our environs.
<P align="justify">
Safety continues to be a major concern for everyone living in Parkwood, but the recent spate of car break-ins reveals that we have let down our guard, once again.  After all of the discussion and notification that has occurred on the listserv, and within the newsletter, respectively, electronic devices are still being stolen from UNLOCKED CARS.  If you have new neighbors, or out-of-town guests, make sure they know to remove valuables from their vehicles and lock them.  Lock the doors to your homes, even if you're just walking from the front door to the backyard, or vice versa.  Encourage your new neighbors to join the listserv and become PRA members, even if you have not.  After all, information sharing oftentimes reduces victimization.
<P align="justify">
The next meeting of the Parkwood Residents Association will occur on Monday, October 19<SUP>th</SUP>, at 7:30 p.m., in the multi-use room of Kensington Parkwood Elementary School.  This will be a two-hour meeting to give us time to discuss issues related to the White Flint Sector Plan.  Our guest speaker for the evening with be Marc Elrich, at-large county council member.  He will update us on the sector plan, where the council stands on moving it forward and answer questions from PRA members.  The WF Sector Plan has the potential to affect everyone living in Parkwood as it may impact school redistricting, property values and our ability to commute in a timely manner on the area's roadways.
<P align="justify">
White Flint is separated from Bethesda Naval by less than two miles and there appears to be little coordination between the two projects on the infrastructure improvements needed to manage thousands of additional vehicles on the Route 355 corridor daily.  The state and county currently face a $210 million shortfall just to pay for the infrastructure improvements that have been planned around Bethesda Naval.  How do they plan to pay for the infrastructure necessary to support an expanded White Flint with thousands of additional dwellings and a more than a million square-feet of commercial space?
<P align="justify">
On October 5<SUP>th</SUP>, the Coalition of Military Medical Center Neighbors, to which PRA belongs, met with Congressman Van Hollen, Lt. Governor Brown and County Executive Leggett to discuss issues related to both short- and long-term visions for dealing with infrastructure improvements surrounding the Bethesda Naval Medical Center.   An update will be provided at the October 19<SUP>th</SUP> PRA meeting.
<P>
I look forward to seeing you at what should be a very informative meeting.
<P>
Sincerely,<br>
Bailey Condrey, PRA President

<B><U>CEDAR LANE BRIDGE</U></B>
</CENTER>
<P align="justify">
As mentioned in the Summer 2009 PRA Newsletter, the Montgomery County Department of Transportation issued a newsletter in July 2009 providing an update on the reconstruction of the Cedar Lane Bridge. Construction is planned to begin Spring 2011, with a pedestrian bridge to be constructed prior to the roadway closure scheduled for Summer 2011.  It is anticipated that construction will be completed before BRAC in Fall 2011.

<B><U>NEW ONLINE CRIME REPORTING SYSTEM</U></B>
<P align="justify">
The Montgomery County Police Department recently unveiled an On-Line Citizen Reporting System (CRS), which allows the reporting of minor crimes on the Internet.  CRS can be used to report theft, vandalism, identity theft, and lost property.  It should be used for an incident that:
<P align="justify">
<ul>
<li>Is not emergency</li>
<li>Occurred within Montgomery County (but not within Takoma Park, NIH, park, or metro property) </li>
<li>Is not a motor vehicle accident </li>
<li>The value of property stolen is less than $10,000 </li>
<li>Has no known suspects </li>
<li>Did not happen on the interstate</li>
</ul>
You can access CRS at: <A HREF="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/poltmpl.asp?url=/content/pol/coplogic/cologic.asp">http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/poltmpl.asp?url=/content/pol/coplogic/cologic.asp</A>.
<P>
You can also file a police report by calling the Montgomery County Police non-emergency number at (301) 279-8000.

<I>A reminder to clean up after your dog.</I>  The PRA Beautification Committee has funded the installation of biodegradable dog waste bag dispensers in the neighborhood.  Gerald Sharp, PRA Treasurer, installed one of these dispensers on the easement between Edgefield Road and Parkwood Drive, a high traffic area for dog walkers, about a year ago.  The PRA Beautification Committee is planning to install more of these dispensers in other high dog walking traffic areas near trash cans.  If anyone has suggestions for other areas where they might be deployed and where someone is available to refill the dispenser as needed, please contact Gail Condrey, Chair of the Beautification Committee, at <script>genAddr("gdalfere", "gannett", "c");</script>.

<B><U>WHITE FLINT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN</U></B>
</A>
<P align="justify">
In July of this year, the Montgomery County Planning Board approved and transmitted to the Montgomery County Council a final development plan for the White Flint Sector.  The plan can be accessed at <A HREF="http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/community/whiteflint/">http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/community/whiteflint/</A>.
<P>
Key points of the new plan include:
<ul>
<li>86,000 people living and working in White Flint (currently 25,000)</li>
	<ul>
	<li>9,800 new dwelling units in addition to 2,220 in the pipeline for a total of over 14,000; 37,000 people will live in the new White Flint</li>
	<li>5.68 million square feet of non-residential space in addition to 1.8 million in the pipeline for a total of 12.98 million square feet - or 48,600 jobs</li>
	</ul>
<li>300 foot building heights; the Plan will allow buildings taller than the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and JBG's
new Whole Foods building for a mile along Rockville Pike</li>
<li>Development located between Montrose Parkway and Edson Lane including along Nebel Street and Nicholson Court</li>
</ul>
Concerns have been raised about the plan's impact on traffic and the environment, and whether the plan includes infrastructure to address these issues. Notably, the plan does not include or account for any of the impact the BRAC development will have on our community.  The Planning Board also failed to provide a coherent plan - or funding - for an elementary school for the new residents of White Flint.  Overcrowding of existing K-12 schools is likely to occur, and the Planning Board has raised the idea of redistricting the WJ cluster as a possible solution.  All Parkwood residents, with or without children, should be concerned about this as it could greatly affect neighborhood property values.
<P align="justify">
There is no doubt that this plan will greatly affect Parkwood.  The plan has been approved by the Planning Board and will be presented to the County Council on October 20, with a vote expected in early November.  PRA encourages Parkwood residents to become familiar with plan and have their voices heard:
<ul>
<li>Review the Draft Development Plan</li>
<li>Attend the October 19th PRA meeting at KPES.  Marc Elrich, At-Large County Councilmember, will be attending to the discuss the White Flint Sector Plan</li>
<li>Attend the Public Hearing to be held by the Montgomery County Council concerning the White Flint Sector Plan -
Tuesday, October 20 at 7:30, Council Bldg, 100 Maryland Ave., Rockville, MD</li>
<li>Submit comments to the County Council (District 5 Councilmember Valerie Ervin; At-Large Councilmembers Marc Elrich, Nancy Floreen, George Leventhal, Duchy Trachtenberg) at <A HREF="mailto:county.council@ montgomerycounty md.gov">county.council@ montgomerycounty md.gov</A>
or (240) 777-7900 and County Executive Ike Leggett at <A HREF="mailto:ocemail@montgomerycountymd.gov">ocemail@montgomerycountymd.gov</A>.
Comments can be sent by mail to 100 Maryland Avenue, Rockville, MD 20850.</li>

<U><B>PARKWOOD'S VIRTUAL COMMUNITY</B></U>
<P>
Come join Parkwood's "other" community!  Get connected to your neighbors on the PRA's website at
<A HREF="http://www.parkwoodresidents.org">www.parkwoodresidents.org</A> and the PRA e-mail group (listserv) on Yahoo! Groups.
<P align="justify">
Maintained by PRA webmaster Peter Mansbach, the PRA website includes a wealth of information about our community and the PRA, including contact information for local officials, minutes from past PRA meetings, past issues of the newsletter, maps of recent crimes in the community, and other great resources.  Recently, the website moved servers and is no longer hosted by geocities.  This means no more advertisements, as well as increased bandwidth - both of which make the website easier to access and maintain.  Please make note of this change and remove any bookmarks you have to the geocities website.  As always, you can still access the website at
<A HREF="http://www.parkwoodresidents.org">www.parkwoodresidents.org</A>.
<P align="justify">
Almost half of Parkwood households are connected to each other via the PRA listserv.  This e-mail group is open to all residents of Parkwood, and a great way to plan community events, such as block parties and playgroups, and share information, such as the latest news affecting our neighborhood or referrals for service providers. This listserv can save the PRA funds and make Parkwood a safer place to live by allowing neighbors to communicate with each other in real time. Sign on to the listserv and get your neighbor to as well!  To subscribe to the listserv, send a blank message to:
<A HREF="mailto:parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</A>.
You will receive a confirmation message when you are subscribed.  Do not write anything in the subject or body of the message.  It will not be seen by anyone and you will not get a response.<br><br>
