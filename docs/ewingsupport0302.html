The Honorable Steve Silverman<br>
President, Montgomery County Council<br>
100 Maryland Ave.<br>
Rockville, MD 20850<br>
<P>
Dear Councilmember Silverman:
<P>
On behalf of the Kensington Parkwood Resident's Association, I am writing in support of 
County Councilman Blair Ewing's proposal to re-prioritize the County's capital budget to put 
schools first.  In addition to the benefits the schools provide to the students enrolled in them, our 
much-vaunted "world class" school system is Montgomery County's strongest economic 
development tool.  It would be incredibly short-sighted of County officials to neglect the schools 
in favor of other, less universally beneficial projects.
<P>
Kensington Parkwood Elementary School has had its modernization continually pushed back, yet 
other non-essential projects are continuing on schedule. Today there are children receiving 
reading instruction in former supply closets, on all-purpose room stages, and in staff offices.  As 
voters and taxpayers, we are requesting that council vote to fully restore the school CIP budget 
so that much needed and planned modernizations and additions can be built. 
<P>
Mr. Ewing's proposal is an important step toward addressing the abysmal state of the school 
construction schedule.  The Parkwood Resident's Association, comprised of 913 homes in the 
Kensington area, fully supports Councilmember Ewing's initiative to move schools back into the 
forefront of the capital budget, where they belong.  We urge other councilmembers, particularly 
Mr. Berlage who has been elected to serve residents in the Parkwood community, to support this 
position as well.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Elizabeth Brennan<br>
President<br>
Parkwood Resident's Association<br>
