<P>
<B>At long last,</B> the Parkwood Residents Association returns to the newly redeveloped Kensington Parkwood Elementary School for its regular meeting on Monday, September 25. The agenda is as follows:<BR>
<ol>
<li><B><I>Should Parkwood become a municipality? --pros and cons</I></B><BR>
Guest speaker Al Carr currently serves on the Town of Kensington Council.  As such, he has a deep understanding of how municipalities work, and can share with us his experiences in the incorporated Town of Kensington.  Come learn more and tell us what you think!</li>
<li><B>Update on traffic control in Parkwood</B> presented by Lara Akinbami (see article below).</li>
</ol>
Come meet your neighbors, share ideas, and enjoy the new school building!
<P>
<B><U><BIG>President’s Message:</BIG></U></B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Some of you may wonder why we would take up the subject of Parkwood becoming a municipality. This subject was briefly discussed on the listserve earlier this summer, and it seems an interesting subject about which most of us know nothing. A few of the advantages that were pointed out include the ability to set caps on the amount of property taxes raised. For instance, while our cap is set at 10%, municipalities such as the Town of Kensington and Chevy Chase View have caps of 5%. Another pro is the ability to specify building set backs, lot coverage, and height restrictions for new construction, and to generally have more say in the character of our neighborhood. Since Al Carr is familiar with how municipalities work, he has offered to educate us on both sides of the issue. We need your point of view on the subject.
<P>
We had a very good turnout and spirited discussion at the June meeting, which was my first meeting as president of PRA. With many new families moving to Parkwood, I hope there will also be new volunteers for the activities that keep PRA going. Becoming active in this organization is a great way to meet your neighbors and to keep the neighborhood the great place it is. A small number of individuals work very hard. Apparent benefits for all of us are the welcoming island at Cedar Lane and Saul Road, and the informative quarterly newsletter that is delivered to all homes whether they have joined PRA or not.
<P>
The summer of 2006 has brought us the deluge in June that flooded many of our basements, followed by a long lasting heat wave, and then drought in August. It was also characterized by intermittent power outages, as usual. Just recently Ernesto blew through and did a little of the tree trimming that the county has been so slow to do. I hope to see many of you at the September meeting, and I welcome your suggestions on subjects you would like us to discuss at future PRA meetings.

<B><U><BIG>Update on Traffic Control:</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
At the June PRA meeting, we discussed exploring options to calm speeding traffic through the neighborhood.  At PRA’s request, the Montgomery County Department of Public Works and Transportation (DPWT) will conduct traffic studies on portions of roadways identified by residents to have heavy traffic (at least 100 cars per hour) traveling at excessive speed.  The DPWT asks residents to identify the 60-minute period during which unsafe driving is of greatest concern to help pinpoint the most useful time to conduct a study.  After the DPWT receives PRA’s list of roadways, the county will conduct studies and, depending on the results, will recommend options for traffic calming.  Options include "horizontal" measures (roundabouts, curb extensions, medians, edgelines) and "vertical" measures (speed bumps, raised crosswalks).   Before any road engineering takes place, at least 80% of the residents of the affected roadway must be in agreement with any proposed measure and the PRA must endorse the measure before it is enacted.  We resolved at the June PRA meeting to gather requests from residents about traffic trouble spots and to submit the requests to DPWT after review at the September PRA meeting.
<P>
These are the trouble spots identified by neighbors to date:
<ol>
<li><U>Everett St</U>. (one-way segment). Main concern: cars driving the wrong way.</li>
<li><U>Parkwood Dr. between Franklin St. and Wildwood Rd</U>. (7:30-8:30 am and 5:30-6:30 p.m.).  Main concern: pedestrian safety.</li>
<li> <U>Parkwood Dr. between Puller Dr. and Saul Rd</U>. (7:30-8:30 am).  Main concern: cut-through traffic traveling at excessive speed.</li>
<li><U>Franklin St. between Beach Dr. and Saul Rd</U>. (3:30-4:30 pm).  Main concern: heavy traffic and pedestrian safety.</li>
<li><U>Franklin St. at intersection with Wildwood Rd</U>. (7:30-8:30 am): cut-through traffic traveling at excessive speed.</li>
</ol>
<P>
We will be discussing these requests for traffic studies at the next PRA meeting and moving forward to submit them to DPWT.  If you wish to identify other roadways that need traffic studies, please send me an email <U>before</U> the September meeting.  <B>Please include the specific roadway with cross streets, main traffic concern, and the most problematic 60-minute period during which a traffic study is needed.</B>  To review traffic calming options in more detail, see the presentation made at the last meeting at the Parkwood Residents Association site (http://www.parkwoodresidents.org).

<P>
The Smithsonian Resident Associates program is sponsoring two walking tours of Wheaton's ethnic markets, on October 1 and October 15 (both are Sundays) from 10 am to noon.  The tour will be led by a Smithsonian food expert/Montgomery College professor.  The two tours will be essentially the same, and there will be recipe ideas and tastes along the way.  SEE WHAT'S IN OUR "BACKYARD"!  The cost is $25 for both members AND non-members (very unusual!), so you do NOT have to be a member to participate.  LIMIT OF 25 ATTENDEES PER TOUR - so get your reservation in soon!

<B><U><BIG>CKC Update</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
The Coalition of Kensington Communities hosted a candidate’s forum for county council At-Large and District 1 & 5 on July 12<SUP>th</SUP> at the Town of Kensington Armory. In follow-up all participants were asked to complete a brief questionnaire on Kensington-specific issues. This information was posted on the PRA website in late August.
<P>
At the July meeting CKC representatives heard from  Nancy Soreng, President of the Montgomery County League of Women Voters on the county budgeting process.   Town of Kensington Mayor Pete Fosselman provided an update on the Town’s activities. The CKC also provided information on a proposed development at the Forest Glen Metro that will have an impact on Kensington traffic. The CKC will be launching their website in September. The next meeting is scheduled for September 28<SUP>th</SUP>

<B><U><BIG>Renew Montgomery Request Update</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
We are still working with the county to see that all of the projects on the PRA’s Renew Montgomery Request are reviewed and implemented. Remediation of the Franklin/Beach Drive intersection was done in July, county tree trimming and removal crews went through Parkwood over the summer, and curb construction for a portion of Dresden Street is being scheduled.  The PRA request is available on the website at: <A HREF="http://www.parkwoodresidents.org">www.parkwoodresidents.org</A> under the documents ("Docs") section.

<B><U><BIG>Retired Scientists & Engineers Volunteer Project</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
Montgomery County Public School (MCPS) Volunteer Project has partnered with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the Senior Scientists and Engineers (SSE) to develop a program engaging retired scientists and engineers with science teachers and students. The program will place retired scientists and engineers in classrooms to work with teachers to improve student science learning.  The emphasis is on enhancing the science education of all of the students, and not just a subset.  As many scientists have emphasized, there is continuing concern about the lack of understanding of science and its methods by the general public, resulting in part from inadequate science education in school.  A pilot program has been completed and the recruiting phase is now under way. Retired scientists and engineers are asked to participate in this important program and volunteer approximately 20 days during the school year to the project.  Orientation will be the week of September 11, 2006.  If you accept this invitation to volunteer, please send the following information to Sarah Ingraffea (<A HREF="mailto:singraff@aaas.org">singraff@aaas.org</A>): <I>name, home address, email address, telephone number, fax number (if you have one), and highest university degree.</I>  Also include a brief description, not exceeding 150 words, to introduce you to your teachers and that they, in turn, can use to introduce you to their students.
<B>If you know of anyone who would be interested please pass this on and encourage them to participate.</B>
