Dear Mr. Roshdieh:
<P>
On behalf of the Parkwood Resident's Association we would like to share our support of the skate boarding 
activity at the Housing Opportunities Commission playground.   The PRA met in early March to discuss this 
activity. The meeting was comprised of approximately 60 people with a balance of seniors, parents with school-
aged children as well as residents without children. The group voted overwhelmingly to support the concept of 
skate boarding for the children (of all ages) in the Kensington community. 
<P>
During the discussion, it was noted that there are several parks/playgrounds in the Kensington area that offer 
recreational opportunities such as basketball, tennis, ballfields and playground equipment, but no parks that 
offered an area for skate boarders, inline skaters, and other similar activities.  It is our hope that this area can be 
dedicated for this activity.  We have been informed that the skaters have established a "Code of Ethics" and 
understand that the use of the grounds is contingent upon their respect for the area with regard to littering, 
maintaining their equipment and curbing the use of foul language. 
<P>
The PRA is comprised of 913 homes within the boarders of Cedar Lane, Beech Drive, Parkwood Drive and 
Westbrook Street.  If there is any assistance we can provide to ensure that the skaters are able to continue their 
activity, please do not hesitate to contact us.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
