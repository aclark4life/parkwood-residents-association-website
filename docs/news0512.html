<B><U>Winter Meeting Has Full Agenda…plus Holiday Cheer!</U></B><BR>
<P>
The next Parkwood Residents Association member meeting, set for Monday, December 5 at 7:00 at the Kensington Park Library, features a Holiday concert by the Kensington Parkwood Elementary School Chorus.  Following the concert, we’ll have an update from John Mitchell of WSCC on the current status of the WSSC’s proposal to construct a large water main from Tuckerman Lane to Beach Drive near the Mormon Temple (under Parkwood!). This proposed 7-foot diameter water supply pipe is necessary to provide sufficient water to rapidly growing areas of the southeastern part of Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties. His presentation will include information on:
<ul>
<li>Overall Alignment</li>
<li>Description of the Construction Method</li>
<li>Duration of activity, traffic impact, permanent impacts, temporary/park impacts</li>
<li>Overall Project Schedule</li>
</ul>
<P>
Following his presentation, please join your neighbors in some Holiday cheer as we share desserts.  Our meetings are usually so full of business; let’s take just a little time to get to know each other better.
<P>
<B><U>Kensington Parkwood Elementary School Modernization Update:</U></B><BR>
<P>
The end is in sight!  The general contractor is scheduled to complete construction work in mid November and MCPS will review punch-list items through December. KP’s temporary Grosvenor site will close on December 23<SUP>rd</SUP> and re-open at the new school on January 5<SUP>th</SUP> in order to give teachers time to pack up and set up their classrooms.
<P>
Members of the PRA and the KP PTA met with MCPS officials in September to review issues regarding landscaping and topography. There are concerns about the buffer areas between the school and homes on Edgefield Road and Parkwood Drive, the sustainability of the new shrubs and trees without a plan (or funding) for maintenance, and the reduction of the sledding hill. Negotiations are continuing with MCPS on these issues.
<P>
<B><U>Circle Manor – Pending Sale:</U></B><BR>
<P>
On November 17, the Planning Commission unexpectedly postponed action to approve the sale of Circle Manor to the County.  There was no public explanation for the sudden delay, raising questions whether the agreement worked out with the developer, Bristol Kensington, is now in jeopardy.  There are rumors flying around about possible other uses for Circle Manor by the County, none of them suggesting preservation of the Warner mansion and surrounding property or even maintaining its use as an elder care facility.  Nor are we hearing positive signals that the county will include the Town of Kensington in a meaningful partnership.  Given the importance of this parcel to the Town’s historic character, the PRA encourages you to contact Planning Commission Chairman Derick Berlage at 301-495-4600 and ask him why the vote was delayed.  Kensington Town Council held an emergency executive session on November 18, although the results were not known in time for this publication.  Look for updates through the PRA listserv.
<P>
<B><U>Coalition of Kensington Communities Update:</U></B><BR>
<P>
The CKC met in September.  Agenda items included:
<ul>
<li>Review of CKC testimony regarding the proposed changes to the Annual Growth Policy</li>
<li>Update on the Kensington Master Sector Plan schedule</li>
<li>Legislation to increase density at the American Speech Hearing Association Development</li>
<li>Status of the Circle Manor sale</li>
<li>New Westfield housing development proposed near Wheaton Plaza</li>
</ul>
<P>
The group was scheduled to meet again on Thursday November 17<SUP>th</SUP>.   We will try to have an update at our December 5 PRA members’ meeting.
<P>
The CKC is a unified body of area civic associations founded to enhance the quality of life in the
<ul>
<li>Kensington area. Current participants include the following:</li>
<li>Byeford – Rock Creek Highlands (400 homes)</li>
<li>Capital View Park Citizens Association (330 homes)</li>
<li>Garrett Park Citizens Association (325 homes)</li>
<li>Garrett Park Estates – White Flint Park Civic Association (650 homes)</li>
<li>KenGar Residents Association (110 homes)</li>
<li>Kensington Estates Civic Association (425 homes)</li>
<li>Kensington Heights Citizens Association (715 homes)</li>
<li>Kensington View  (156 homes)</li>

<li>Rock Creek Palisades Citizen’s Association (1700 homes)</li>
</ul>
<P>
If you are interested in representing the Parkwood neighborhood on the CKC please contact Liz Brennnan.
<P>
<B><U>Pepco & Parkwood:</U></B><BR>
<P>
PRA President Liz Brennan toured the neighborhood with the Pepco forester and community liaison on Monday, November 14<SUP>th</SUP> to review the condition of trees that impact Pepco lines. They checked the lines/trees on public property and found only two trees impacting the lines. Those trees will be pruned immediately. <I>Please note that the Pepco lines are the very top wires; telephone and cable wires are below.</I> Many of those telephone and cable lines (we observed) are impacted by trees but the cable and telephone companies do not monitor or maintain tree growth.  It is up to the homeowners/residents to monitor the dedicated lines from the street to your home. Pepco will trim trees on your property that affect your dedicated line. The forester also mentioned that due to the droughts in 1999 and 2000 it is expected that many trees will die in the upcoming year. It takes three to five years for a tree to die as a result of drought. Please be sure that you monitor the street trees near your home and report dead/dying trees to the county (DPW) 24 hour hotline : 240-777-7165 or the Highway Maintenance Section of the Division of Operations 240-777-7623.
<P>
Additional Info from the county website: <A HREF="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/hwytmpl.asp?url=/content/dpwt/operations/highway/tree.asp">http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/hwytmpl.asp?url=/content/dpwt/operations/highway/tree.asp</A>
<P>
<B><I>TREE REMOVAL:</I></B> Trees are removed for a number of reasons including death of the tree, structural defect, declining health, etc. Requests to remove a tree from the public right of way should be made to the Division of Highway Services. Requests are inspected to determine if the tree should be removed. If it is determined that a live tree should be removed, an application for a removal permit is submitted to the State Forester. If the permit is approved, removal is scheduled. If the permit is denied, the resident requesting removal is informed of the State's action. Occasionally, trees that require removal have power lines in close proximity to parts of the tree. In this case, the removal of the tree must be coordinated with PEPCO, which can add to the length of time required to effect the removal of the tree.  To request a tree removal contact the Highway Maintenance Section of the Division of Operations 240-777-7623.
<P>
<B><I>STUMP REMOVAL:</I></B> Upon removal of a tree, the location of the stump, if any, is noted in our tree management system for future "removal." Removal consists of the mechanical grinding of the stump and those exposed roots radiating from the stump out to where the roots first enter the ground. The stump and roots are ground to a depth of 6" below the surrounding ground level. The wood chips are removed and the hole filled with a topsoil mixture and the surface seeded with grass. The dirt is left mounded slightly to allow for settlement as the remaining underground portions of the stump rot. It is helpful for the establishment of the grass to water the seeded area until the grass is established.
<P>
<B><I>TREE MAINTENANCE:</I></B>  Tree Maintenance is performed by the Highway Sevices Section of the Division of Operations under a permit granted by the Maryland State Forester's Office. Under the Maryland Roadside Tree Law, all trees growing on a publicly maintained right of way are considered part of the State Forest. Any activity which can affect the health of these trees, such as pruning, removal, insect and disease control, planting, root cutting, etc., requires a permit from the State Forester. For information regarding The Maryland Roadside Tree Law or to request a permit, call 301-854-6060.
<P>
<B><I>TREE PLANTING:</I></B> Montgomery County plants approximately 1800 trees per year to replace trees that have been removed from the public right of way. Trees are replaced by the County on a request basis or they can be replaced by the adjacent resident at their expense. If you desire to plant a tree which is not on the approved tree list, you should contact the Division of Highway Services at 240-777-7623 for approval of your selection. We ask that you do this so that we can advise you on the acceptability of your choice because certain varieties of trees may cause problems. Also, should you wish to plant a tree, a permit is required from the State Forester's Office, which can be reached at 301-854-6060.
<P>
<B><U>Have a New Neighbor?</U></B><BR>

The PRA is looking for ways to reach out to newcomers in the neighborhood.
