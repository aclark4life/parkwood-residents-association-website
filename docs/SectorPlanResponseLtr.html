<P>
Dear Ms. Lueders,
<P>
Thank you for your letter regarding the Kensington Sector Plan. At the time it was
received, your letter was distributed to the entire Council. I am responding on their behalf.
<P>
The Council has approved the work program for the Planning Department, which
establishes the master plan schedule. While the Council agrees the Kensington Sector Plan is of
great importance to the Country, limited resources forced us to prioritize projects and did not
allow us to accelerate preparation of this plan, as we would have preferred.
<P>
In March 2007 the Planning Board proposed delaying the start of the Kensington Plan by
one year. The Council was able to slightly reduce this delay to nine months. Planning staff will
begin work in the spring of 2008 and the Council should receive the Plan in September 2009.
We regret that we were unable to keep the Plan on its original schedule.
<P>
The Council appreciates receiving your comments on this issue. As the Plan begins, you
are encouraged to contact the Planning Board to ensure your views are considered.
<P>
