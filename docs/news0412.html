<B><U><BIG>Neighborhood Directory Coming!</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
Great news!  We can soon look forward to a free directory of all our neighbors in Parkwood, thanks to Jan Thomas, a long-time Parkwood resident.  Jan will sponsor the cost of this directory as an associate broker of Long and Foster.  She will be using information already available from public records, such as the telephone directory.  Watch for a mailed notice from her in January listing the information she plans to publish about your household.  You may choose to edit it, and can add information, such as any special service you can provide.  <I>You may also choose not to be published in the directory by returning the notice to her.</I>  Or, if everything’s fine as is, you won’t need to do anything to be included in the directory.

<P>
The PRA is looking for ways to reach out to newcomers in the neighborhood. A PRA welcome packet has been developed and Welcome Committee Chair Kathy Byars and PRA Block Captains have been diligently passing our packets out. If you would like to welcome a new neighbor or have Kathy or one of her volunteers drop off a packet, please contact her at 301-530- 9585 or at

<B><U><BIG>A New Name:  The Garden Club is now Beautification Committee!</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
Did you know that the Parkwood Garden Club has been active since the very early days of Parkwood?  At our last PRA meeting, Jean Wisching, co-chair of the Parkwood Garden Club (along with Claire Murphy), presented the Garden Club’s five-year plan for improving the public grounds in our neighborhood.    Most recently, you can see the Club’s ongoing handiwork at the Saul Road island which is beautifully maintained by a handful of neighbors.
<P>
But the Garden Club needs your help.  With an annual budget of only $275, members have contributed their own money as well as labor to keep up the island, and there have been fewer volunteers in recent years.  At the same time, there is a desperate need to tackle some other public areas that don’t get enough attention from the County, such as the Wildwood island.  So the Club has set the following goals for 2005:
<ul>
<li>Change name to Beautification Committee to better reflect its mission.</li>
<li>Continue maintaining Saul Road island using PRA budget and volunteers.</li>
<li>Apply for a Neighborhood Beautification grant from the County for Wildwood island, identifying neighborhood volunteers to undertake and maintain the improvements.</li>
<li>Begin a study for clean up and additional signage at Franklin Street and Parkwood Drive entrances to Parkwood.</li>
</ul>
For 2005, PRA is asking its members to make an additional voluntary cash contribution to the Beautification Committee when they renew their membership.  <I>Please see the check-off box on the membership renewal form at the end of this newsletter!</I>
<P>
The newly renamed Beautification Committee benefits us all by improving the appearance of our public areas, giving Parkwood a welcoming and well-maintained look so important to our property values! Can you help? Please contact Jean Wirsching at (301)493-8667.

Have you joined the PRA listserv?  191 of your neighbors have!  They’ve been sharing information about local vandalism/petty crimes, requesting/offering referrals for handymen, general contractors and car repair places, area physicians and more. The PRA listserve is the best way to stay connected to your neighbors 24/7. The e-mail group is open to all residents of the Parkwood subdivision. To subscribe, send a blank message to: <A HREF="mailto:parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</A>.  You will receive a confirmation message when you are subscribed.  Do not write anything in the subject or body of the message.  It will not be seen by anyone and you will not get a response. This listserv can save the PRA funds and more importantly make Parkwood a safer place to live! Sign on to the list serve and get your neighbor to as well!
