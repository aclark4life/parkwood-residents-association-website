<H2>Message From the President</H2>
<H4><I>Liz Brennan</I></H4><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
The summer has flown by all too quickly and soon Parkwood residents will be
gathering again to discuss issues of importance to our community.
Our next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, September 17th at the
Kensington Parkwood (KP) Elementary School s All Purpose Room.
We had a turn out of over 60 people at the last meeting and I am
encouraged that we will continue this success in future meetings.
<P>
A week before our meeting is Primary Election Day -
<B>Tuesday, September 10th</B>.
This election is extremely important.  <B><I>Local politics has the greatest
impact on our lives</I></B> and all seats on the Montgomery County Council are
up for election.  The District 5 seat is open since our elected
representative Derick Berlage stepped down and was appointed to
head Maryland National Capital (MNC) Park and Planning Board.
I am sure that all of you have seen the many yard signs featuring
candidates for the races including County Council, State Senate and
Delegate, Board of Education and U.S. Congress that are sprouting
around the community.
<P>
Please take the time to read up on the candidates and their positions
on issues of importance to you.  The group that presented at the June
Parkwood meeting, Neighbors for a Better Montgomery, has posted
questionnaires on their website (<A HREF="http://www.neighborspac.org">
www.neighborspac.org</A>) for almost
all of the candidates running for council and the state race.
Their questionnaire is fairly comprehensive and covers issues such
as traffic, schools, development, environment and health care.
Each candidate also has literature at the local library and on
their own websites.  The League of Women Voters of Maryland website
is also a good resource for information on the candidates.
<P>
Parkwood was affected by the recent re-districting and as a result
the Bethesda part of Parkwood is now in District 18 instead of 16.
This only affects the state race, not the County Council or U.S.
Congressional race.  We have an opportunity to vote for a new state
Senator, as our current representative, Chris Van Hollen, is not
running for that position again.  Three candidates are running,
two of which live in Kensington!  The 3 delegate seats are also
open; 4 others are challenging the incumbents. The Montgomery County
delegation to Annapolis is responsible for bringing our state tax
dollars back to us.  It is important that we elect the brightest
and most capable representatives for this important task.  Once again
it is interesting to note that while District 18 covers a large
territory, including Silver Spring and Wheaton, many of the folks
running reside in Kensington.
<P>
To quote a resident at our last meeting:  <I>"It's all political, if we want
something for our community, we have to work the machine."</I>  Well, the first
important step is to ensure that Parkwood has a strong voter turnout for this
election.  The politicians will pay attention to us if they know we are engaged
in the process. The polling place for Parkwood residents is KP School.  I am
the precinct chair for Parkwood and I hope to see you on September 10th!

<H2>Proposed Bioterrism Facility at NIH</H2>
<H4>Kira Lueders</H4><BR><BR>
<P>
I am writing this to share information which has not been widely publicized
but may be of interest to the Parkwood community (my apologies to those of you
who have seen this on the Listserve).  I am a long-time resident of Parkwood
and also an employee of NIH. This Spring I read in the <I>"NIH Record"</I> a
story titled <I>"New Facilities to Bolster Anti-Bioterror Effort"</I>. The
facility described is to be part of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) effort to counter emerging viruses and pathogens
worldwide.  The proposed six story building is to be located at the northeast
corner of NIH, close to the intersection of Rockville Pike and Cedar Lane, and
will include BSL-3 laboratories. Such laboratories are used to work with
biological agents that "may cause serious or potentially a lethal disease as a
result of exposure by the inhalation route". Presumably this could include
agents such as anthrax. Other agents that have been mentioned are the plague
and smallpox.
<P>
Such facilities are already available to NIH at more remote locations such as
Frederick, Maryland and Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Colorado where
additional facilities could also be built if necessary.  Strong justification
should be required to build such a facility in this densely populated area (a
few miles from Parkwood) and directly across the street from a school.
Apparently there has been no review of these plans either internally at NIH or
by the county.  According to the M-NCPPC, the county does not have plans to
review the building because there is a "laboratory building" at the site on the
NIH Master Plan, and the Plan has been approved by the county.
<P>
I have attended two meetings of the NIH Community Liaison Council (CLC) as a
representative of the PRA to learn more about this facility without success.
The leadership of the CLC, which handles issues of concern to neighborhoods
around NIH, changed in July, and the new head of the Council was not willing to
discuss the facility before he had familiarized himself with the issues.
However, it is clear from my conversations with representatives of other
community associations that there is a great deal of opposition to this NIH
facility from the surrounding neighborhoods. The NIH Alumni Association has
sent a formal resolution to Dr. Zerhouni, the new director of NIH, expressing
their opposition to this facility being built. In addition to the possibility
that disease organisms could escape from the facility, such a facility would
also increase pressure for even more intensive security at NIH, and could also
make NIH more of a potential target for those who wish to do harm. I hope to
get additional information about this facility at the CLC meeting in August
which I can share with the community at the PRA meeting in September. I think
this is an issue of importance to all of us who live in Parkwood.

<H2>Update on Kensington-Parkwood Elementary School Modernization</H2>
<H4>Pam Moomau, Walter Johnson Cluster Coordinator</H4>
<P>
At our last meeting, the PRA, after a fair amount of discussion, voted to
support the proposed design for the Kensington Parkwood Elementary School
modernization before a Montgomery County Planning Board hearing on June 13,
2002.  Because the PRA vote was not unanimous, it was agreed that the letter of
support should include the reported vote count. Such a letter was sent to the
Planning Board. This <A HREF="kpltr0602.html">letter</A> is posted on the PRA
website.
<P>
Parkwood residents and others testified both for and against the plan at the
hearing on June 13.  The Planning Board requested that MCPS re-submit the plan
with modifications.  Required modifications focused on the provision of a
reforestation plan for the site by Montgomery County Public Schools.  MCPS was
requested to consider, in particular, the feasibility of moving the student
drop-off/parking area away from the north side of the site (along Saul Road) to
save five  specimen trees, and of saving one additional specimen tree by
reducing the footprint of the portion of the building along Saul Road through a
multi-story design. After MCPS has completed its revised plans, the Planning
Board will hold a second hearing on the project.  It is anticipated that this
hearing will occur in September.

<H2>Parkwood Residents Association E-Mail Group</H2>
<P>
In order to provide a constant source of communication for the Parkwood
Community, it was decided in March of this year to create an e-mail group. Many
thanks to Heidi Lipson who worked so diligently to get this communication tool
up and running so quickly.
<P>
What is the Parkwood Residents Association (PRA) e-mail group? The PRA e-mail
group is an forum to discuss community news and events.  You can post a message
for all other group members to read and respond to and you will receive
messages posted by others.  An e-mail group is also known as a listserv.  The
PRA e-mail group is set up in Yahoo Groups (<A HREF=
"http://www.groups.yahoo.com">www.groups.yahoo.com</A>).
<P>
<I>Who can join?</I><BR>
The e-mail group is open to all residents of the Parkwood subdivision who have
an e-mail address.
<P>
<I>How do I participate?</I><BR>
To subscribe to the e-mail group, send a blank message to:
<A HREF="mailto:parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">
parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</A>
<P>
Do not write anything in the subject or body of the message.  It will not be
seen by anyone and you will not get a response. You will then receive
confirmation.
<P>
We currently have about 50 Parkwood residents utilizing this tool and strongly
encourage all to sign-on. Email traffic on the Parkwood listserve is light, but
can serve as an important resource if enough residents participate.
