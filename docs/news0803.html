<B><U><BIG>Calling for Nominations – New Officers to be Elected at Next PRA Meeting</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
It’s that time again for some of us long-time PRA officers to step aside and let new energy and enthusiasm step up!  We’ve had several PRA members nominated for several officer positions, and we’re hoping to get nominations from the floor.  Please plan to attend our next meeting on Monday, March 31 at 7:30 and make your voice heard.  We need your participation!  Nominees so far are as follows:
<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="5">
  <TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
  <TD>President<br>Vice President&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Secretary<br>Treasurer</TD>
  <TD>?????<br>Julie Tierney<br>Maryann Dillon<br>Gerald Sharp</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
Stepping down from duties are Kira Lueders, President; Maryann Dillon, Vice President and Newsletter Editor (who has offered to run for Secretary); Brenda Marshall, Secretary; and Paula Flicker, Treasurer.
<P>
Kira Lueders has done the hard work of President these last two years, taking the helm from Liz Brennan, who served for four years and can be credited with reviving PRA into the vibrant neighborhood association it is today.  Kira has built on this momentum, but now deserves a well earned break.  Are you willing to step up to the plate?  We need your leadership!  In addition to the office positions, <I>we continue to seek a new chair of the Beautification Committee</I>.  Can you help?
<P>
The PRA could not exist without the help of many volunteers in addition to the officers, all of whom deserve our thanks:

<B><U><BIG>Micro Paving Issue for Discussion at 3/31 Meeting</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
Residential streets in Kensington and other older areas in the down county were resurfaced in recent years with a rough, unattractive material called 'micro pave'.  Approximately 250 lane miles of streets have had this process done. Numerous citizen associations have complained about micro pave's rough texture that inhibits recreation, is ugly in appearance, and was so poorly applied that early deterioration is likely.  Unfortunately, Parkwood was among the neighborhoods that were micro paved in 2007. At the January 2008 meeting of the PRA, we had a spirited discussion with representatives from the County Department of Public Works and Transportation. A campaign is now underway to organize micro paved communities into a single voice that can urge the Country to restore these newly degraded residential roads. Parkwood has the option of joining this campaign if the residents opt to do so.
<P>
The County Executive's capital budget proposes a 100% increase in road resurfacing funds in order  to discontinue micro pave in favor of hot mix asphalt and other smoother materials.  This is good news for other communities that will now be spared micro pave.  But the County has no plan to restore neighborhood roads that remain harmed by micro pave.  Unless the County Council and Executive take notice, our communities will be left behind with no relief in sight.
<P>
Fritz Hirst, board member of the Rollingwood Citizens Association (Chevy Chase area), is trying to identify citizen associations that are willing to sign a letter to the County Council requesting relief for micro paved communities.  One possible remedy is to put these neighborhoods at the top of the County repaving list in the next cycle. From comments at the January meeting and also on the PRA listserve, this is an issue for many of us and for our neighborhood. <B><I>PRA has invited Fritz Hirst to come to the March 31st meeting to talk about this issue.</I></B>  You can contact Fritz at <A HREF="mailto:fhirst@msn.com">fhirst@msn.com</A>.  A website is also under development that provides additional information:  <A HREF="http://www.sosmontgomery.com">www.sosmontgomery.com</A>.

<B><U><BIG>New Sidewalk Requested:</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
At the January PRA meeting, members voted in favor of Peter Mansbach’s application to the County requesting a new sidewalk on Franklin Street from Edgefield Road to Beach Drive, a route many pedestrians use to get access to Rock Creek Park and to Metro.  This application requests that the County determine the feasibility of such a sidewalk.  Should the County determine that a sidewalk be appropriate, there would be public hearings before any final decision would be made.
<P>
You may have seen some dialog on the PRA Listserv regarding Department of Public Works and Transportation (DPWT) staff photographing potential sidewalk areas along Parkwood Drive from Franklin to Cedar.  While this is not the area that Peter requested, nor did PRA vote on any application for Parkwood Drive, it appears that some neighbors have requested a sidewalk over the years.  In response to President Kira Lueder’s request for information, Jan Melvin of DPWT posted the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Per a request from Tom Pogue I am responding to e-mails concerning a proposed sidewalk along Parkwood Drive.  Multiple requests have been made over the last few years to construct a sidewalk along Parkwood Drive from Franklin Street to Cedar Lane. After Tom Pogue attended a PRA meeting on January 7, we received e-mail correspondence inquiring into the status of the requests for a sidewalk along Parkwood Drive.  A preliminary site evaluation was conducted and determined that substantial tree removal would be necessary in order to construct this sidewalk.  An investigation was scheduled for detailed construction impacts with the constructing a sidewalk at that location. The investigation was conducted, which is where our construction inspector was noticed taking pictures of the proposed sidewalk construction site.  Detailed construction impacts regarding the proposed sidewalk will be sent to property owners who reside adjacent to the proposed sidewalk.  It will allow the residents an opportunity to provide our office with comments concerning the proposed project. All sidewalk construction requires a public hearing be conducted to determine whether or not to proceed to the construction phase.  If this project is recommended for a public hearing, our office will provide notification to the adjacent property owners.  If there is a residing homeowners or civic association for the Parkwood community, I would encourage the residents to contact them to voice their comments concerning the construction of a sidewalk along Parkwood Drive.
<P>
If you have any questions regarding the status of this proposed project, please contact our office by e-mail or at 240-777-7270.
<P>
Jan Melvin’s direct line is (240)777-7271.

In a related matter, Liz Brennan, our CKC Liaison, asked our new District 18  State Delegate Al Carr to help with the Renew Montgomery Request for street lighting that falls under the state domain. Delegate Carr sent the following letter to Arthur Holmes, Director of DPWT for Montgomery County on January 29:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Many of my constituents who live in the Parkwood neighborhood walk to the Grosvenor Metro Station. The route to the station takes them along Beach Drive and then along the east side of Rockville Pike to the escalators.  The path along Beach Drive is well lit and people feel safe.  However the lighting is inadequate on the connector road between Beach Drive and Rockville Pike and also along Rockville Pike itself. In the words of one of my constituents, walking at night along here feels "spooky".
 I toured the area personally one evening this week and saw first-hand that the lighting could use improvement. The connector road is very dark. Also, this stretch of Rockville Pike has the old mercury vapor lamps on the Pepco poles. As you know, mercury vapor lamps are short-lived, grow dim quickly and are frequently burned out.  Please take the necessary action to upgrade the lighting along this route. Thank you addressing this important constituent concern.

<B><U><BIG>Rock Creek Park Clean-Up:</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
Last year many of us joined the Boy Scouts in Parkwood to help with the annual Rock Creek Park clean-up. It was a perfect Spring day, and we collected an amazing amount of trash.  Check out the account of our efforts in the June 2007 newsletter, which can be found on the PRA website under “docs”. With the recent heavy rains, the Park seems to once again need our help. Friends of Rock Creek’s Environment have listed Saturday, April 5, 2008 from 9am-noon as the time for clean-up near Parkwood.  While we don’t have all the details yet, last year’s clean-up check-in was at the park entrance at Saul Road and Parkwood Drive.  Watch for an announcement on the PRA Listserv as more information becomes available.
