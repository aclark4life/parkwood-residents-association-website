<B>Coalition of Kensington Communities Update: </B>
<P>
<I>The Coalition of Kensington Communities is a unified body of Kensington-area civic associations with the goal of enhancing the quality of life in the Kensington area.  Toward this end, the CKC works with local governments to address issues of development, design, recreation, transportation, pedestrian accessibility, and economic growth affecting the greater Kensington.  Currently, the CKC membership includes 9 civic associations, representing 5,354 single-family households.</I>
<P>
1. As a result of the recent census election districts for Montgomery County have been modified. For the County Council Parkwood is now part of District 1 and represented by Roger Berliner. The greater Kensington community is now presented by 3 districts (we were just one before – District 5), in addition to Parkwood being moved to District 1, Kensington Estates, the Town of Kensington and Rock Creek Hills are all now District 1.  KenGar, Kensington Heights and Kesington View are part of District 4 (Nancy Navarro) and 5 (Valerie Ervin).  CKC will be meeting with these representatives and the at-Large reps (Floreen, Leventhal, Reimer and Elrich) in 2012 with a goal of keeping them in touch with the issues that matter to us most.  No changes to our State Representatives. Not sure of the status of Board of Education representation.
<P>
2. BCC Middle School #2 – last Fall the CKC wrote to the Planning Board and the Board of Education in opposition of using the Rock Creek Hills park for a new middle school. Major considerations were the size of the lot is too small - according to MCPS the standard of 20 acres is required for a middle school. The Rock Creek Hills site is 13.38 acres. Additional the selection process was flawed and notification to residents process not followed. The Board of Education voted in December to open up the site selection process again. Funding will be placed in the CIP for construction.  The site announcement is expected in March 2012.
<P>
3. Costco Gas Station – CKC opposes this gas station b/c:
<ul>
<li>The newly approved Wheaton Sector Plan prohibits this proposed use –zoning does not allow this</li>
<li>Potential environmental hazards inherent in this proposed gas station/ 18 pumps adjacent to a community swimming pool</li>
<li>Gas station site is 4/10ths of a mile from the Wheaton Metro platform </li>
<li>No additional gas stations are needed in the Wheaton-Kensington area</li>
</ul>
<P>
<B>Sector Plan Update</B> – important for residents to pay attention to these as sector plans include recommendations that impact traffic, environment, public amenities such as schools, community centers, libraries, police stations and zoning (balance of commerical/residential and industrial).
<P>
4. Wheaton Sector Plan was approved by the county council in November. Residents are encouraged to read the details at: <A HREF="http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/community/wheaton/">http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/community/wheaton/</A>
<P>
5. We are monitoring the plans for the Chevy Chase sector plan. The developer proposal was rejected –they want too much density. Planning Board instructed the developer to work with the community on a resolution. A new proposal is expected in February. See details: <A HREF="http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/community/chevychaselake/">http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/community/chevychaselake/</A>
<P>
6. Kensington Sector plan: this plan has been in committee (county council public housing and economic committee) since October. CKC testified regarding the sections of the plan that were remanded back to the Planning Board by the Council for further review.  CKC testimony is attached.  Details on the sector plan can be found at:

<P>
Additionally I would urge any Parkwood residents that have questions about the plan to contact Fred Boyd at the Planning Board – he has been working on this for the past 5 years and is extremely knowledgeable about the current status as well as the process. You may contact Fred at:

If anyone has any questions about the issues we are tracking, please do not hesitate to contact me!
