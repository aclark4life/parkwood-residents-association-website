<P><H2>PRA Meeting To Be Held March 12 </H2>

<P>Voice your opinion, cast your vote, and meet your neighbors at the next meeting of the <B>Parkwood Residents Association (PRA) </B>to be held <B>March 12 at 7:30pm</B>.  The meeting will be held in the downstairs room of the Kensington Library at 4201 Knowles Avenue.  Help us to revive this very important neighborhood organization.  Items on the agenda include the election of new officers, an update on issues effecting our neighborhood and the formation of committees to carry out neighborhood interests. <br>

<P><H2>PRA Has Executive Board Vacancies</H2>

<P>After many years of loyal service to the neighborhood, Dan Shepherdson, President and Jerry Miller, Treasurer will be stepping down from their
positions this spring.  This means that all positions in the Executive Board of the Parkwood Residents Association are open. Positions include two
Co-Presidents, a Treasurer, and a Secretary.  This is a great opportunity to get involved in your community and make a difference in the issues that are important to you and your neighbors!
<P>
We have two volunteers for the positions of Co-President.  Liz Brennan has lived in the Parkwood Community for 16 years. She is a Past PTA
President at Kensington Parkwood ES and is currently serving as Cluster Coordinator for the Walter Johnson Cluster.  She has 15 years experience in the not-for-profit health care industry and is currently providing consulting services for area organizations.   She, along with her husband of 19 years, Tim, are raising 3 children, Matthew 16, David 12, and Meghan 6.
<P>
Liz is interested in addressing quality of life issues including: increased traffic (and Beltway noise), exploring additional pedestrian access options to Grosvenor, advocating for a community center and working toward a more community-oriented business center along Connecticut Ave.
<P>
Valerie Gottron and her husband, Doug, have lived in Parkwood for almost nine years. They have two children, Delaney (2) and Mikayla (10 months).
Valerie has been involved in many community events and activities.
Professionally she has been a real estate agent for more than fifteen years. She is now with Long &amp; Foster Realtors. Prior to her real estate career she worked in radio and television and also in Marketing and Promotions.
<P>
Valerie would like to help create an active Parkwood Residents Association as has existed in the past. She would like to get people involved and help to instill a warm, caring sense of community in our little neighborhood. She feels that the recent tragedies of 9/11 and other World events have
triggered a reaction in most people to stay physically and emotionally close to their home and communities. <br>

<H2>Kensington Parkwood ES Modernization</H2>
<P>
As most Parkwood residents know, Kensington Parkwood Elementary School is a 50-year-old school that badly needs to be renovated and updated. KP was scheduled to be &quot;modernized&quot; during the 2002-2003 school year. However, the County Executive has recommended that the modernization of KP be delayed until <br>
January 2006 due to overall weakness in the economy. The school PTA has been lobbying the County Council and School Board to have the modernization completed as soon as possible. A &quot;new&quot; school, which may include a gym, will be an asset for Parkwood and the entire Kensington community. Parkwood residents are invited to write to the County Council and the School Board if they would like to express support for the modernization. For more information, please contact Dan Shepherdson, at (301) 564-4381.

<h2>Debate Over Re-Opening the Gym at the HOC Building</h2>
<p>
For the past several months the <i>Kensington Gazette</i> has been faithfully reporting the community discussions regarding the gym at the Housing Opportunities Commission (HOC) which is currently housed in the old
Kensington Elementary School. Up until 1998, the gym was used for recreational basketball through the
Department of Recreation. For a variety of reasons, including perceived under utilization, the gym was closed and is currently being used by the HOC for file storage.
<p>
Representatives from several area organizations have been meeting with County Council members to work toward not only re-opening the gym, but also to explore the possibility of housing a part-time community
center. This part-time concept would include game tables such as ping-pong, air hockey, etc. and a
recreational staff person to serve as a supervisor.  Currently the Kensington residents do not have access to a
community center facility.  Residents that live on Detrick Avenue, across from the HOC, have voiced their
opposition to re-opening the gym as it will increase traffic, noise and litter on their block.   The March meeting of the PRA will allow for an opportunity for the Parkwood neighborhood to weigh-in on this topic.

<h2>Kensington Residents Form Coalition</h2>
<p>
In response to mounting frustration regarding quality of life issues, area residents have formed an umbrella organization to work together to address common areas of concern.  The Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC) is a unified body of area civic associations and townships founded to enhance the quality of life in the Kensington community. Towards this end the group will work with local government to address issues of
urban design, recreation, transportation, pedestrian accessibility and economic growth affecting greater
Kensington.
<P>
The CKC held its first meeting in January at the Kensington Firehouse, and PRA was represented by several residents.  The following committees were established during this meeting: Traffic, Pedestrian Access/safety, Land Use, Parks and Recreation and Economic Development. It is a goal to have a minimum of representative from each neighhborhood on each committee.  If you are interested in becoming involved with the Coalition, please contact Liz Brennan at 301-530-3615.  The next meeting of the CKC is Tuesday, March 26th , 7:00 pm at the Firehouse.

<h2>Block Captain System to be Resurrected</h2>

Captain, you would be responsible for the dissemination of communications from the association to the
residents on your block in an situation where there is not enough time to mail a newsletter or when an issue needs a quick response.  Block Captains are also needed to report new residents on their block to the Welcome Committee.  We need a volunteer to be the <i>Block Captain Director</i>. Please indicate on your survey if you would be willing to serve as a Block Captain or call Valerie Gottron at (301) 493-9002.
