<B><U><BIG>PRA Officer Elections to be held at March 21 Meeting</BIG></U></B>
<P>
Please mark your calendar for the next PRA meeting, Tuesday, March 21st, 7:30 pm at the Kensington Park Library. We are not able to meet at the new school until this Fall as it is an MCPS policy not to rent the facility within the first 6 months after re-opening.  In addition to the general business meeting (including election of officers) we will also have 2 presentations:
<ul>
<li>Joe Davies of CABE will provide an update of recent efforts by CABE to express its opposition to a proposed expansion of the Beltway, and PRA members will vote on our position regarding this proposal.  See article below.</li>
<li>Parkwood Eagle Scout Ryan Martin will provide a presentation on Emergency Preparedness.</li>
</ul>
<P>
The PRA will hold elections for new officers at this meeting.  Nominations are sought for the following: <I>President, Vice President</I> (or Co-President) and <I>Treasurer</I>. Brenda Marshall has graciously agreed to continue to serve as Secretary.  The jobs are not terribly time-consuming or difficult and the term is for two years.  Responsibilities include:<BR><BR>
<B>President:</B><BR>
<ul><li>secure meeting space for 4 meetings annually</li>
<li>collect agenda items</li>
<li>secure speakers (when requested by membership)</li>
<li>run quarterly meeting</li>
<li>assist with writing newsletter articles</li>
<li>post announcements on listserve</li></ul>
<B>Vice President:</B><BR>
<ul><li>produce quarterly newsletter and distribute to block captains or mailhouse</li>
<li>set-up meeting announcement signs one week before quarterly meetings</li>
<li>attend quarterly meetings</li></ul>
<B>Treasurer:</B><BR>
<ul><li>Deposit dues and donations (0-2 times per month, depending on the time of the year)</li>
<li>Reconcile bank statement with receipts. (Quarterly statements)</li>
<li>File tax letter for non-profit corporation each year.</li>
<li>Manage PRA bank account, reimburse members for PRA expenses.</li>
<li>Provide detailed expenditure lists when requested by PRA officers. (requested only twice in past 4 </li>years)
<li>Produce draft budget based on previous year’s income and expenses.</li>
<li>Provide a treasurer’s report for each PRA meeting</li></ul>
<P>
On the whole, these jobs are fairly easy, taking, perhaps, 1-2 hours per month outside of the PRA meetings.
<P>
Please consider stepping up to help out with this. The PRA has become a strong organization and it would be a shame to let it languish. The current officers will be available to support the new volunteers. Please email Liz Brennan at: <A HREF="mailto:brennanhouse@verizon.net">brennanhouse@verizon.net</A> or call 240-535-7564 if you have any questions or are interested in one of the positions.
<P>

<B><U><BIG>Citizens Against Beltway Expansion (CABE) to Present at 3/21 PRA Meeting</BIG></U></B>
<P>
Joe Davies of CABE (formerly called the Rock Creek Coalition) will provide an update of recent efforts by CABE to express its opposition to a proposed expansion of the Beltway. The Maryland State Highway Administration is studying a plan to widen the road to ten lanes, of which four would be toll lanes built and managed by a private company.  CABE held a meeting on January 9 with citizens' associations from around the Beltway and public interest groups to organize a plan to oppose the State's widening proposal; <B><I>PRA was not represented at this meeting and has not taken an official position on this latest proposal.</I></B> However, the PRA has a long history of opposing Beltway expansion, as this would have a considerable impact on noise, intrusion into Rock Creek Park, and the taking of some homes in other neighborhoods abutting the Beltway.  Since the January 9 meeting, CABE has distributed almost 20,000 flyers in neighborhoods located near the Beltway, including the flyer enclosed in this newsletter. On January 24 County Council President George L. Leventhal and Council Member Steven A. Silverman joined CABE in a press conference to express firm opposition to Beltway widening. Council members Floreen and  Perez have also expressed strong support for CABE’s position.  PRA member Marion Woods-Lubbert has volunteered to represent PRA at future CABE meetings.  <B><I>We intend to take a vote of PRA members present at the March 21 meeting regarding what position, if any, PRA should take on this latest proposal.</I></B>  Please come to make your voices heard.
<P>
<B><U><BIG>Emergency Preparedness Presentation:</BIG></U></B>
<P>
Ryan Martin, a life scout completing his eagle project, will present information on emergency preparedness at the PRA meeting on March 21.  Ryan will hand out helpful fliers on how to be ready when disaster strikes. There are numerous disasters that could strike our area ranging from terrorists attacks to natural disasters, but there are a few essential components to preparing for each. Ryan also will host a follow-up in-depth meeting in April (dates will be given out at the PRA meeting) at the Kensington Park Library where he will have his volunteers teach you everything you need to know.  Miguel Ascurranz, the Emergency Preparedness Director for Montgomery County, will speak as well.
<P>
<B><U><BIG>Kensington Parkwood Elementary School Tour</BIG></U></B>
<P>
KPES  principal Mr. Ceschini (aka Mr. C) will take Parkwood residents on a tour of the new facility on Tuesday, March 7th at 6:30 pm and answer any questions. Residents are invited to have coffee/dessert with PTA members after the tour and to attend the PTA meeting.  In addition, the KPES PTA Modernization Committee is requesting feedback from residents regarding the new school. In particular for Parkwood residents we would like your comments on the grounds or traffic flow.  If you have any observations, questions or concerns, please forward them to Liz Brennan at
<A HREF="mailto:brennanhouse@verizon.net">brennanhouse@verizon.net</A> or 240-535-7564.
<P>
<B><U><BIG>Status of the KPES Sledding Hill</BIG></U></B>
<P>
One key issue with the KPES modernization has been the elimination of the sledding hill behind the school, long an important recreational feature for Parkwood.  Preservation of this hill had been a major discussion point between the KPES PTA and MCPS throughout the design process, yet MCPS chose to fill in much of the hill with excavated soils from the site rather than hauling these soils off.  At the end of last year PRA President Liz Brennan (and Co-Chair of the KP Elementary School PTA modernization committee) wrote to District 3 Board of Education representative Patricia O’Neill regarding the loss of the hill, and received a written response from Larry Bowers, COO for MCPS that did not propose any solution. A second letter from Liz went unanswered.  Liz has subsequently spoken with Pat O’Neill twice regarding this issue and while she deeply regrets this turn of events, there isn’t money in the MCPS budget to remediate these errors. To those of us who experienced the fun of sledding down the KP hill, this unfortunate decision by MCPS is truly a blow.

<B><U><BIG>College Board Names Walter Johnson HS #1 AP World History Program in the World!</BIG></U></B>
<P>
If you watch the evening and/or morning news, then you have probably heard about Walter Johnson High School being named the #1 Advanced Placement (AP) World History Program in the World by the College Board, the organization behind the AP program. Channels 4, 5, 8, and 9 all ran stories about the honor.  Each year, the College Board names the top programs for each AP exam/subject area based upon the number of students who participate and those students' success on the AP exam. It is an impressive achievement for any school.  In Maryland, Walter Johnson was the only school to be recognized, and it was the only non-magnet public school to be recognized in the Maryland/DC/Virginia metropolitan area. The exclusive nature of this recognition should make us even more proud of our students and our faculty.
<P>
<B><U><BIG>Circle Manor Update</BIG></U></B>
<P>
State Senator Sharon Grosfeld, who represents Kensington, has introduced a bill in Annapolis to authorize the issuance of $1.6 million in state bonds to raise funds in part for the Town of Kensington to use as its 25% matching share of the purchase price of Circle Manor.  The bond issuance is conditioned upon conveying conservation easements on the property to the Maryland Historical Trust for future preservation. A vote is expected some time in March.  Citizens United to Save the Circle (CUSC), along with the Kensington Historical Society and Kensington Land Trust, strongly support this legislation as a means of preserving the Circle from potential development beyond its historic footprint, and as a way to avoid a referendum by the Town on whether residents should be taxed as an alternative way to finance the town's 25% share of the purchase. Senate Bill 192 would thus help preserve the property and save Kensington property owners from higher taxes.
Prospects are uncertain as to passage so your support is needed!  Contact Geraldine Darcy or Marie White, aides to Senator Grosfeld, at 301-858-3137 / 410-841-3137, or through the link to the entire Montgomery County delegation: <A HREF="http://montgomerycountydelegation.com/address-list-2003.asp">http://montgomerycountydelegation.com/address-list-2003.asp</A>

<B><U><BIG>New Parking Regulations on Franklin Street</BIG></U></B>
<P>
With a new entrance to KPES on Franklin Street as well as Saul Road, there are new parking signs along Franklin which prohibit parking during school hours.  Please be aware of the signs and know that police may start to ticket cars
in violation.  As a result of the <I>Safe Routes to School</I> initiative, a program to evaluate all school zones in the County to assure maximum safety for walkers, "No Stopping Any Time" signs have been installed at the intersection of Woodfield Road and Franklin Street.  A marked crosswalk and stop line have also been approved to be installed on Woodfield Road at Franklin Street (this work is on the schedule once pavement marking work begins in the spring).   A "No Stopping School Days, 8AM - 4PM" regulation is posted on the north side of Franklin Street between Saul Road and the school driveway.  This is intended to provide sufficient visibility at this intersection of the street and the busy school driveway and to eliminate student drop-off/pick-up on the street.
<P>
<B><U><BIG>Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC) Update</BIG></U></B>
<P>
The CKC met in January to discuss the most recently submitted plans by Centex for Symphony Park (the old American Speech Hearing Association site), the Kensington Sector Plan process, update on the Grosvenor Metro Development and the Park and Planning Document: <I>Montgomery County in the 21st Century: Revitalizing Centers, Reshaping Boulevards and Creating Great Public Spaces.</I>  A Gazette reporter attended the meeting and the meeting was reported in its February 1st issue.
<P>
The CKC made the following request to Park & Planning regarding Symphony Park:
<ul>
<li><B>Legacy Open Space.</B> Legacy Open Space land should be acquired before development and subtracted from the acreage of the entire parcel before base density is calculated.  From CKC’s reading of the materials, neither is currently planned.</li>
<li><B>Density.</B>  The developer now plans only attached, 40-foot-high townhomes concentrated along Strathmore Avenue, which CKC believes is incompatible with the single-family, detached, R-60 zone in the neighboring community  The incompatibility is made even more egregious by the 22% density bonus being applied to the entire acreage, thus further increasing the number of residences.  On the incompatibility issue alone, CKC does not support this development as currently planned.</li>
<li><B>Moderately priced dwelling units (MPDUs).</B>  CKC is concerned that the developer plans to produce substandard-sized housing units to fulfill its MPDU requirements at a requested lot size of 1,248 sq.ft., which is 17% below the minimum 1,500 sq.ft. standard for this project.  CKC implores the Planning Board to consider mandating that Centex make the outward appearance of the MPDUs as close to that of the market-rate units as possible, for a variety of reasons not the least of which is to make MPDUs into livable space consistent with the development around it.</li>
</ul>
<P>
It was noted that the final phase of the “smart-growth” development at the Grosvenor Metro is out to bid.
<P>
With regard to the <I>Montgomery County in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century</I> document, the group felt that the document raised more questions than it answered.  As a result the CKC representatives will formally submit these questions to Park and Planning. Additionally the group decided to raise public awareness on this future planning and growth document.
<P>
The next meeting will be held on March 30th, 7:00 pm at the ASHA building. If you have any questions about the CKC or would like to participate in the activities contact Liz Brennan at <A HREF="mailto:brennanhouse@verizon.net">brennanhouse@verizon.net</A> or 240-535-7564.

<B><U><BIG>PEPCO Tree Removal Update:</BIG></U></B>
<P>
As a follow-up to last Fall’s meeting with PEPCO, Kira Lueders has dutifully compiled a list of trees needing maintenance and trimming within Parkside’s public spaces and forwarded the information to the county.  After about 3 weeks with no reply, she
then sent the information to State Senator Sharon Grosfeld who then raised the issue with George Leventhal,  President of the Montgomery County Council.   The following is a written response Kira received from Guy Turenne, Tree Maintenance Program Manager of the Montgomery County Highway Maintenance Section:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>PEPCO is normally pretty good about dealing with branches affecting their lines. Unfortunately, the same can not be said about either the phone or cable companies.  Since deregulation almost 20 years ago, their attitude seems to be that it is more cost effective to wait until there is a service disruption than to do any proactive tree pruning which they routinely did prior to deregulation.   The County Tree Maintenance Program has only been funded for emergency work for about the last eight years.  Our program has no money to do Comcast's or Verizon's work for them.  Any locations where the only problem is tree branches in utility lines will not be addressed by the County.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Mr. Turenne can be reached at (phone) 240-777-6000 or e-mail <A HREF="mailto:guy.turenne@montgomerycountymd.gov">guy.turenne@montgomerycountymd.gov</A>.  Thanks, Kira,  for your persistence!
<P>
<B><U><BIG>Parkwood Vandalism Incidents</BIG></U></B>
<P>
Many thanks to neighbor Carol Placek for compiling this list from notices posted on the PRA listserv.  Please, if you become aware of any vandalism or other criminal incident, notify your neighbors on the PRA listserv so we can all stay more alert.

The PRA is looking for ways to reach out to newcomers in the neighborhood. A PRA <B>welcome packet</B> has been developed and Welcome Committee Chair Kathy Byars and PRA Block Captains have been diligently passing our packets out. If you would like to welcome a new neighbor or have Kathy or one of her volunteers drop off a packet, please contact her at ( 301)530-9441 or to send an email to:

We now have 305 Parkwood residents signed up for our listserve, the best way to stay connected to your neighbors 24/7. The e-mail group is open to all residents of Parkwood, and a great way to share information, such as home improvement contractors or petty vandalism affecting our neighborhood. To subscribe, send a blank message to: <A HREF="mailto:parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</A>.  You will receive a confirmation message when you are subscribed.  Do not write anything in the subject or body of the message.  It will not be seen by anyone and you will not get a response. This listserv can save the PRA funds and make Parkwood a safer place to live! Sign on to the list serve and get your neighbor to as well!

<U><BIG>2006 PRA Membership Dues are Due!</BIG></U>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Parkwood neighborhood is 1,000 households strong.  All households, whether members or not, receive this newsletter free during the year, and all are invited to join the listserv at no charge.  Further, your PRA officers and members are hard at work protecting your interests and advocating for Parkwood.  <I>You can support our efforts for a modest $10 a year.</I>  Those funds are used to defray costs, pay for beautification efforts, support the newsletter, and much more.  Please consider joining.  When we advocate with elected officials, we are much more effective when we can state that a high percentage of residents are members.
<P>
Please see the membership form below.  You may join at the next meeting, or return this form to Kitty Stone.  We’re hoping to hear from you!</B></BIG>
