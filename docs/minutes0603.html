Eagle Scout Ryan Martin and his colleagues presented a talk on Emergency

disasters such as floods, storms or tornadoes, and serious accidents such as
home fires, and possible acts of terrorism such as chemical spills.
Information regarding plans that families should have such as emergency
contacts was presented.  The elements of a disaster kit were demonstrated.
This presentation was being followed by a presentation on April 8th.

Liz Brennan informed the meeting attendees that the "Renew Montgomery"
letter has been sent out and will be posted on the PRA website.  The letter
included requests for traffic calming and tree removal.

<P>
Beltway:   Since no one from Citizen¹s Against Beltway Expansion (CABE) was
present at the meeting as had been planned, Peter Gavin reported on the CABE
meeting that he attended.  He reported that the latest idea being considered
for the Beltway is to make a portion of the roadway a toll road.  He noted
that this plan would still involve adding lanes.  The issue is whether or
not expansion will do any good, especially in view of the congestion on
access roads.  CABE¹s view is to concentrate on alternative plans.  It
should be noted that the Purple Line continues to be a long-term idea.
Peter also noted that CABE has re-formed due to the upcoming elections.
<P>
Discussion of the Beltway and possible impact of changes to the Beltway
ensued.  Mary Ann Dillon noted that the section of the Beltway near
Kensington is the most congested portion of the Beltway.  It was pointed out
that additional lanes are likely to be on the Parkwood side of the Beltway
because there is no room to expand on the other side.  There was some
discussion of whether or not expanding the Beltway would decrease
congestion.
<P>
Despite the absence of a representative from CABE or from the state, a
motion was made by Bill Zwack that PRA be opposed to widening the beltway.
His motion was seconded.  The vode was 29 for the measure and 5 opposed.
The motion passed.
<P>
An additional motion to send a representative to CABE and to have the PRA
executive committee decide whether or not PRA would join CABE was made and
seconded.  The motion passed.
<P>
An additional motion to oppose a fly-over ramp was also made, but tabled.
