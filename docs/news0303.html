<P>
<B>NIH Bio-terrorism Facility Update</B>
<DIV ALIGN="right">
<I>Submitted by Kira Lueders,Ph.D.</I>
</DIV><BR>
In response to opposition from surrounding neighborhoods to the proposed
biodefense facility, NIH has agreed to carry out a  hazard/risk assessment
study. The results of the study will be reviewed by a task group made up of 3
members of the NIH Community Liaison Council and an NIH official, and I will be
part of this group. The Council now includes a representative from Stone Ridge
School. Additionally a staff member from Rep. Van Hollen's office has attended
recent meetings in response to his interest in this issue. It is difficult to
predict what effect, if any, a negative study result would have on NIH plans,
and it may not be possible to prevent the construction of  this facility at the
corner of Rockville Pike and Cedar Lane. However, I will strenuously continue
to oppose NIH plans to use live anthrax in this facility (Building 33).
<P>
Dr. Kira Lueders is the Parkwood representative on the NIH Community Liaison
Council. If you have any questions or would like to contact Kira she can be

<B>Rockville Pike Traffic Relief</B>
<DIV ALIGN="right">
<I>Submitted by Eleanor Rice, Locust Hills Estates</I>
</DIV><BR>
Are you or someone else in your community significantly inconvenienced by the
no left turn between 4-6 on Rockville Pike and Cedar Lane (east)?  The Maryland
State Highway Administration wants to give us a left turn, 24/7, but this
involves narrowing the median strip for several hundred feet on Rockville Pike
to create a "holding lane".  This can be accomplished <U>this year</U> with
funds already in their budget. We have to identify it as a priority so the
district engineer can take our correspondence or e-mails when he presents
before the new secretary of transportation.  If you live in the 18<SUP>th</SUP>
legislative district, write or e-mail State Senator Sharon Grosfeld, 9906 Old
Spring Road, Kensington 20895 or e-mail at
<A HREF="mailto:sharon_grosfeld@senate.state.md.us">
sharon_grosfeld@senate.state.md.us</A>. Tell her how important this traffic
project is to your daily commute and access to your neighborhood.

<B>CKC Writes to County Executive</B>
<DIV ALIGN="right"><I>Submitted by Liz Brennan</I></DIV>
<BR>
At its January meeting, the Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC) hosted
newly elected council member from District 5 Tom Perez and Carol Bowis,
Legislative Aide to Council Member Howard Denis, District 1. The purpose of the
meeting was to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the issues of importance to
the residents of the Kensington area.
<P>
The CKC is a one-year-old umbrella group comprised of 11 resident/civic
associations in the greater Kensington area. Current participants include:
Byeford -- Rock Creek Highlands, Capital View Park Citizens Association,
Garrett Park Citizens Association, Garrett Park Estates -- White Flint Park
Civic Association, KenGar Residents Association, Kensington Estates Civic
Association, Kensington Heights Citizens Association, Kensington View, Parkwood
Residents Association Rock Hills Citizens Association and Rock Creek Palisades
Citizen's Association.
<P>
The group voted to write a letter sharing top priorities to County Executive
Doug Duncan with copies to the Montgomery County Council President and State
Representatives in District 16, 17 and 18. The letter urged Mr. Duncan to focus
on the following issues in the County's FY04 budgets:
<ul>
<li>Community Center at the HOC site in Kensington
<li>Adequate Fire and Rescue Services throughout the County
<li>Focus on Solving Local Traffic Issues
<li>Maintain the School Modernization Schedule
</ul>
Another theme that resonated through-out the neighborhoods was a desire for the
revitilization of the Kensington Business District. Several community leaders
indicated an interest to move more aggressively on the Kensington Concept Plan.
This item was not included in the letter to the Executive as it is primarily
the Town of Kensington's responsibility to advocate on this issue. A copy of
the Kensington Concept Plan is available at the Town Hall.  The next meeting of
the CKC is Thursday, March 27<SUP>th</SUP> to be hosted by the Rock Creek
Palisades.

<P>
<B>Treasurer's Report</B>
<DIV ALIGN="right"><I>Submitted by Chris St. Clair</I></DIV>
<BR>
It is time for the executive committee to recommend a 2003 budget to the PRA
membership. If you or your committee has a need or desire that requires
funding, please make your requests known as soon as possible to one of the PRA
officers so it can be considered in the 2003 budget.

<B>Parkwood Directory Underway</B>
<DIV ALIGN="right"><I>Submitted by Kitty Stone</I></DIV>
<BR>
Many of us have already submitted information to be included in the PRA
neighborhood directory, but there are still many people who haven't been heard
from. The Parkwood Directory can serve as a wonderful resource to make our
neighborhood more cohesive. The more residents listed, the more unified the
neighborhood.
<P>
Please print the
<A HREF="directoryform.html">directory form</A>, fill it out,
and send it to me via email (<A HREF="mailto:castone3@aol.com">castone3@aol.com
</A>), fax (301/564-9574), or mail (4313 Clearbrook Lane, Kens. 20895) so we
can be sure to include everyone who wishes to have their complete information
listed -- and that those who do not wish to be listed are not.
<P>
If you or anyone you know is interested in advertising in the directory
(scheduled for publication in March), please contact Debbie Zwick at
301/581-9392.

<B>PRA List Serve: Join NOW</B><BR>
<BR>
In order to provide a constant source of communication for the Parkwood
Community, a listserv (e-mail group) was created. The listserv is open to all
residents of the Parkwood subdivision who have an e-mail address. To subscribe
to the listserv, send a blank message to:
<A HREF="mailto:parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">
parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</A>.
Do not write anything in the subject or body of the message.
You will receive an automated confirmation message when you are subscribed.
(The reply is automated. If you write
anything, it will not be seen by anyone and you will not
get a response to it.)
<P>
This communication mode can save the PRA funds if we can
encourage all to participate! Sign on to the listserv and get your neighbor to
do so as well!

<B>Block Captain Report</B>
<DIV ALIGN="right"><I>Submitted by Kathy Byars</I></DIV>
<BR>
We are still in need of block captains for certain areas in Parkwood. The
primary responsibility of a Block Captain is to deliver the newsletter twice a
year, in May and November. In order to save money the PRA only mails the
newsletter twice a year and relies on the Block Captains to hand deliver
the other two times.  The following streets are STILL in need of coverage:
Everett, Franklin, Parkwood Drive, Thornwood and Cedar. Contact Kathy Byars at
301-530-9441 if you are interested in helping out.
