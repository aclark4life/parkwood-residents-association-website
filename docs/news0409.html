Parkwood residents will be voting at the Kensington Park Library, 4201 Knowles Avenue, for the next 18 months while the Kensington Parkwood Elementary School is being renovated. Registered voters will receive a sample ballot and voter information in the mail prior to the election.

<B><U>KP School Construction Update:</U></B><BR>
The building was finally completely demolished the last week of September. There were some delays with regard to the start of the project as the contractor was waiting for some last-minute permits to be approved. At this point the project is still on track, with a completion date of August 2005. The school is set to re-open for the students at the semester break in January 2006. In the event that the project falls behind schedule, MCPS developed a buffer to ensure that the building will be ready for the students and staff.  The buffer also provides time to address "punch-list" items without having to worry about the safety of the students or staff.  It is in all of our best interests to have this project completed on time. If you have an issue with regard to the construction, please contact Liz Brennan (301-530-3615 or <A HREF="mailto:brennanhouse@verizon.net">brennanhouse@verizon.net</A>) before contacting the county or MCPS.  Complaints can delay this project; by working through Liz we hope that issues can be resolved quickly and without disrupting the construction schedule.
<P>
<B><U>Parkwood Residents Participate in Town Hall Meeting:</U></B><BR>
Many thanks to those Parkwood residents who attended the County Council  Kensington Town Hall meeting on Wednesday, September 29th, at the Kensington Park Library. The program will be shown on the Montgomery County cable network, channel 6, later this month.  Several Parkwood residents participated by asking questions. Topics included pedestrian safety along the trek to the Grosvenor Metro station, traffic back-ups on Cedar Lane near Rockville Pike, and the decision to replace the White Flint Golf Park with office and apartment buildings. Other local residents brought up issues regarding trash in parks and the effectiveness of the new "Carry In, Carry Out" (trash in parks) program instituted last year.
<P>
<B><U>Have a New Neighbor?</U></B>  The PRA is looking for ways to reach out to newcomers in the neighborhood. A PRA <B>welcome packet</B> has been developed and Welcome Committee Chair Kathy Byars and PRA Block Captains have been diligently passing our packets out. If you would like to welcome a new neighbor or have Kathy or one of her volunteers drop off a packet, contact her at 301-530-8809 or <A HREF="mailto:byarsagent@mris.com">byarsagent@mris.com</A>.

<P>
<B>Kensington Parkwood</B> kicks off its Buy a Brick Fundraiser to support the modernization of the new school. You can leave a lasting legacy at KP by buying an engraved brick. The bricks will be engraved with your name or message and incorporated into the new school grounds. Messages can be up to two lines long, 18 letters or spaces per line. The cost of an engraved brick is $100. Chair of the Engraved Bricks Project, Mary Cassell said that the new school brings lots of opportunities and exciting ways to spend money. Based on a recent survey of staff and parents, the PTA is currently exploring costs for an upgrade (from the standard county package) for the sound and lighting for new All Purpose Room to support the school Arts Integration Program, a science lab, and additional playground equipment. To get more information or to order a brick, contact Mary at <A HREF="mailto:cassellauster@comcast.net">cassellauster@comcast.net</A> or 301-949-5349.
<P>
<B>North Bethesda Middle School</B> is offering Bullying 101: Parent Workshop on Monday October 18th, 7:00-9:00 p.m. at North Bethesda MS. This workshop is designed to inform parents about bullying in the schools and how the community can take an active role in dealing with the problem.
<P>
<B>Walter Johnson High School</B> is experiencing the typical signs of an aging building. With the modernization postponed until 2009, there are a variety of maintenance issues that now confront the school community, including mold and inconsistent air conditioning. School administrators are working with MCPS to address these issues and parent volunteers are supporting the effort as well. School enrollment projections appear to be on target with approximately 1,950 students this year. WJ Principal Kevin Maxwell is being promoted and is leaving in October. Dr, Christopher Garran will serve as Acting Principal for the remainder of the year. A search committee will convene in the spring to select a new principal.

<B><U>Stay Connected to your Neighborhood: Join the PRA Listserv:</U></B>  Parkwood residents have been sharing information about local vandalism/petty crimes and requesting and offering referrals for handymen, general contractors, and car repair places, area physicians, babysitters, and more. The PRA listserv is the best way to stay connected to your neighbors 24/7. The e-mail group is open to all residents of the Parkwood subdivision. To subscribe, send a blank message to: <A HREF="mailto:parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</A>. You will receive a confirmation message when you are subscribed. Do not write anything in the subject or body of the message. It will not be seen by anyone and you will not get a response. This listserv can save the PRA funds and, more important, make Parkwood a safer and friendlier place to live. Sign on to the listserv and get your neighbor to as well!

<B>PRA Minutes — June 28, 2004</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Introduction and Welcome:</B> Liz Brennan introduced herself and the other officers.
<P>
<B>Approval of Minutes:</B> March 22, 2004, minutes were not approved.
<P>
<B>Membership Report:</B> Kitty Stone announced that dues are being collected now for 2004. At present, approximately 150 households are members of the PRA. It was mentioned/suggested to increase dues to $10.00 for each person as opposed to $10.00 per household to help with costs. Nothing was finalized with this idea.
<P>
<B>Guest Speaker #1:</B> Guy Turenne, Tree Maintenance Program Manger for Montgomery County
<P>
Mr. Turenne explained that at present this Department is undergoing reorganization and changes. The Director, Mike Hoit, is no longer in office and this position is vacant. Currently the Department is not actively going out and maintaining trees only concentrating on cutting grass. However, you can contact them and they will be willing to come to your street and take care of a dying tree and/or plant a new tree. To have a tree removed, there is a 12 month waiting period; to have a stump removed it is 24 months. Some residents stated that it has taken longer. Mr. Turene further stated that a resident needs a permit to trim, water, or plant a tree on county property. Their policy is to maintain the existing character of the neighborhood, however, Mr. Turenne stated that too many maple trees were used back in the '70's and now new species are being used. Mr. Turene assessed the health of the trees in the Parkwood area as fair to good. Sidewalk obstruction was discussed and if there was a way to maintain/prevent these issues. Mr. Turene stated that they are only budgeted to landscape maintenance - meaning care of grass. The Parkwood area is budgeted for 12 times a year maximum. However, it usually ends up being only eight times, which breaks down to one mowing in July and one mowing in August. If you have any questions or concerns, Mr. Turenne can be contacted at: DPWT, Division of Operations/Highway Maintenance Section, 240-777-7633 or <A HREF="mailto:Guy.Turenne@montgomerycountymd.gov">Guy.Turenne@montgomerycountymd.gov</A>.
<P>
<B>Guest Speaker #2:</B> Mary Cassell from the Kensington Parkwood PTA; Chairperson KPES
<P>
Mary presented information on the KP Engraved Bricks Project. This project has been developed as a fundraiser to augment the county funding for the Parkwood School renovation. The concept is to offer engraved bricks. All proceeds are dedicated to enhance the school modernization. The bricks can be engraved with either a name or a message and can be up to two lines (18 letters or spaces per line) and will be incorporated into the school grounds. The bricks are being sold for $100 each. A portion of the "bricks" are tax deductible! Mary had a handout announcing the project and an order form to buy bricks.
<P>
It was briefly discussed about having PRA purchase a brick. The Executive Committee met in May and was able to identify $200 (two bricks) from this year's budget that could be used as a donation from the PRA. The school is still in the early stages of this fundraiser but hopes to be up and going strong by the end of the year. Please contact the Executive Committee or Liz Brennan with any feedback you may have with regard to this fundraiser. The placement of the engraved bricks has not yet been determined. It was suggested/discussed about selling the old bricks for $20.00 to help in the fundraising. This will be looked into. This will be further discussed/pursued.
<P>
