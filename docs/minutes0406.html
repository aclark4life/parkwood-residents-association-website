<B>Guest Speaker #1:</B><BR>
Guy Turenne, Tree Maintenance Program Manger for Montgomery County
<P>
Mr. Turenne explained that at present this Department is undergoing reorganization and changes.  The Director, Mike Hoit, is no longer in office and this position is vacant.  Currently the Department is not actively going out and maintaining trees only concentrating on cutting grass.  However, you can contact them and they will be willing to come to your street and take care of a dying tree and/or plant a new tree.  To have a tree removed, there is a 12 month waiting period; to have a stump removed it is 24 months.  Some residents stated that it has taken longer.  Mr. Turene further stated that a resident needs a permit to trim, water or plant a tree on county property.  Their policy is to maintain the existing character of the neighborhood, however, Mr. Turenne stated that too many maple trees were used back in the '70's and now new species are being used.  Mr. Turene assessed the health of the trees in the Parkwood area as fair to good.  Sidewalk obstruction was discussed and if there was a way to maintain/prevent these issues.  Mr. Turene stated that they are only budgeted to landscape maintenance - meaning care of grass.  The Parkwood area is budgeted for 12 times a year maximum.  However, it usually ends up being only eight times, which breaks down to one mowing in July and one mowing in August.  If you have any questions or concerns, Mr. Turenne can be contacted at:

<B>Guest Speaker #2:</B><BR>
Mary Cassel from the Kensington Parkwood PTA --  Chair person KPES
<P>
Mary presented information on the KP Engraved Bricks Project.  This project has been developed as a fundraiser to augment the county funding for the Parkwood School renovation.  The concept is to offer engraved bricks.  All proceeds are dedicated to enhance the school modernization.  The bricks can be engraved with either a name or a message and can be up to two lines (18 letters or spaces per line) and will be incorporated into the school grounds.  The bricks are being sold for $100 each.  A portion of the "bricks" are tax deductible!  Mary had a handout announcing the project and an order form to buy bricks.  <A HREF="kpbricksform.pdf">Order form is attached as a pdf file</A> for your convenience.
<P>
It was briefly discussed about having PRA purchase a brick.  The Executive Committee met in May and was able to identify $200 (two bricks) from this year's budget that could be used as a donation from the PRA.  The school is still in the early stages of this fundraiser but hope to be up and going strong by the end of the year.  Please contact the Executive Committee or Liz Brennan with any feedback you may have in regards to this fundraiser.
<P>
The placement of the engraved bricks has not yet been determined.
<P>
It was suggested /discussed about selling the old bricks for $20.00 to help in the fundraising.  This will be looked into.  This will be further discussed / pursued.
