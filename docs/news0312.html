<B><U>PRA Officer Elections in March 04</U></B> All seats on the <B>PRA Board are up for election</B> for the March 2004
meeting. The positions include President, Vice President (or Co-President), Treasurer and Secretary. The jobs are
not terribly time-consuming and all Parkwood residents are encouraged to participate in the PRA. If you are

<B><U>Council Passes Pay-n-Go Annual Growth Policy</U></B> Earlier this month the Montgomery County Council passed
by a vote of 6 to 3 a new Annual Growth Policy (AGP) that requires developers to pay school and traffic impact
fees for new residential development. The new policy goes into effect July 04. There are currently 24,000 dwellings
countywide in the pipeline that will not be affected by this new requirement and any projects approved between
now and July 04 will also escape the new taxes. <B>Of concern to Parkwood residents</B> is that the new policy does not
offer the option of a building moratorium. The PRA along with the Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC)
the Walter Johnson High School Cluster and others advocated for a policy that would include an effective building
moratorium. There are approximately 4,800 dwellings in the pipeline for the North Bethesda area – none of which
will be taxed for road or school impact. In support of the pay-n-go policy are at-large members Michael Subin,
Steve Silverman,  Nancy Floreen and George Leventhol, District 1 representative Howard Denis and District 2
member Michael Knapp. District 5 (which includes Kensington) councilman Tom Perez along with District 4
councilwoman Marilyn Praisner and District 3 councilman Phil Andrews opposed the pay and go plan.
<P>

<B><U>Have a New Neighbor?</U></B>  The PRA is looking for ways to reach out to newcomers in the neighborhood. A PRA
<B>welcome packet</B> has been developed and Block Captain Chair Kathy Byars and some of her volunteers have been
diligently passing our packets out. If you would like to welcome a new neighbor or have Kathy or one of her
volunteers drop off a packet, please contact her at 301-530-8809 or <A HREF="mailto:byarsagent@mris.com">byarsagent@mris.com</A>.
<P>
<B><U>Coalition of Kensington Communities Update</U></B> The Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC)
hosted an <B>informational forum</B> on November 20<SUP>th</SUP>
 featuring State Senators Sharon Grosfeld (District 18)
and Brian Frosh (District 16) and Delegate Bill Bronrott (District 16). They provided a brief review of the
last state legislative session and an overview of what will likely be hot issues for the upcoming session.
The CKC has developed a list of <B>traffic "hot spots"</B> in the Kensington area and will be working with
Park and Planning, the State and County officials toward solutions for these problems. The CKC is in
need of several volunteers to monitor the <B>Kensington Master Plan/Concept Plan</B> issue. These
volunteers would represent the CKC in meetings with the Planning Board, Town of Kensington and
county government.  There is currently one volunteer from Kensington Heights; at least 2 more are
needed.  Please contact Liz Brennan (301-530-3615) if you are interested in volunteering.
<P>
The CKC is a unified body of 11 area civic associations founded to enhance the quality of life in the
Kensington area. Towards this end the group works with local government to address issues of urban
design, recreation, transportation, pedestrian accessibility and economic growth affecting greater
Kensington. Participation is open to any civic group or governing body in the Kensington area that shares
the commitment to improving the welfare of the community.
