<B>PARKWOOD RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION<BR>
MINUTES  --  September 19, 2005</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Liz Brennan called the meeting to order with a quick overview of the evening’s agenda.
<P>
First Chris St. Clair gave a summary of our budget.  A question was raised on how many members we have currently.  This is a question for the Membership Chair Kitty Stone - but we just received a bunch of new members.  Welcome!
<P>
Liz introduced and thanked State Senator Sharon Grosfeld for attending the meeting as well as the Kensington beat reporter for the Gazette.
<P>
Liz set the format for our guest speakers [from PEPCO]: Zenayda Mostofi, Corporate Affairs and Daniel Landry, Staff Forester.
<P>
Ms.Mostofi briefly spoke about who she was and what her office responsibilities were.  She stated we could call her at her office regarding any power issues. 202-670-8741 or cell phone: 240-508-3591 [webmaster note: my records show 202-872-3590 as her office phone number]
<P>
A PEPCO rep whose main responsibility is working with the circuit on the maintenance side explained in detail on how the maintenance of power lines occurs. He referred to a diagram which reflected the Parkwood grid system.  He did admitt that the circuit on Everett Street had been going out a lot.  He blamed lighting as part of the problem.  He blamed the trees and squirrels as a big factor with problems.  He then stated that a common problem was found with circuit 4447-48 - they have taken those circuits out and fixed the problem. This work was completed end of July 2005.
<P>
It was asked if it helps if more than one person calls with either a branch problem and/or if when power goes out.  YES - the more calls they receive the more likely they will pin point the area and send a truck out.  Everyone should call every 3-4 hours until the issue is resolved.
<P>
The next speaker Mr. Daniel Landry, staff forester from Pepco started to talk about the trees. First, he stated that the "department" was going through a transition in the program for 2006. Starting in 2006 you will contact me or my office, we in turn inform the group, a plan is put onto paper, estimated cost is established, the workers go out and do the work, then the work will be inspected.  There is a list of where they go each year.
<P>
Liz Brennan asked if Pepco could notify her - when and if they were going to be in our area and she would then notify everyone in the community   --  this was agreed to
<P>
Dan gave his phone number 301-670-8741 for anyone to call him directly if they have a problem with a tree on a wire etc.  He made the point to state that no down wires were safe to touch!
<P>
Liz closed the meeting by stating our next PRA meeting would be held December 5th.
