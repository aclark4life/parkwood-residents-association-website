Dear Mr. Pogue:
<P>
The Parkwood Residents Association was formally notified by the County about the Renew Montgomery Program in March 2005. We have gone through a thoughtful and deliberate evaluation process including discussions at our meetings and notifications in our newsletter.  On behalf of the Parkwood Residents I am pleased to submit the following for consideration under the Renew Montgomery Program
<P>
<B>Pedestrian Safety:</B> With the completion of the Grosvenor Metro parking lot, Parkwood has experienced an increased amount of high-speed cut through traffic, most especially on Saul Road. We are requesting additional stop signs at the intersections of Saul and Wildwood and Saul and Woodfield as a pedestrian safety measure. This is especially critical given the proximity to the elementary school – this area has many children walking to and from the school.
<P>
Crosswalks are needed at the following intersections along Cedar Lane so that residents can safely cross the street from the bus stops and walk to the neighborhood pool and churches.  This will ultimately make Parkwood more pedestrian friendly.  Intersections at Cedar Lane &amp; Clearbrook, Dresden, Everett, Franklin, Glenridge and Delmont.
<P>
<B>Tree Maintenance:</B> The attached spreadsheet provides information on street trees that are touching service lines. Please note that the lines are not PEPCO as we have had them out to Parkwood twice this past year to trim trees that were touching their lines.  We were told by the service companies (Verizon, Comcast, etc.) that since they were country trees that it is the county’s responsibility to maintain them.  With so many elderly people living alone we are concerned that a strong wind or storm would bring branches down on phone lines and would create a safety issue for these people. Additionally we have small business owners and telecommuters that rely on DSL connectivity for their livelihood and these trees are risking those lines.
<P>
<B>Traffic Gridlock:</B> As a result of the new Grosvenor Metro lot we are now experiencing significantly increased traffic headed north on Beech Drive toward Rockville Pike. There is a substantial bottleneck as cars attempt to go north/south on Rockville Pike and West onto Grosvenor Lane. We would like a slight roadway widening so that there is a dedicated lane to go north on Rockville Pike (toward the new Metro lot/Strathmore, etc) from Beech Drive this bottleneck would be somewhat relieved.
<P>
<B>Storm Water Drainage</B> is an issue at the corner of Beech Drive and Franklin Street. This intersection is one of the major entryways into Parkwood and because of the lack of drainage mechanism coupled with collapsed pavement water accumulates and creates a driving hazard.
<P>
<B>Curbing:</B> The curbing for a small section of Dresden St needs to be completed.  The majority of Dresden has curbs; there is a section beginning at approximately 4328 to the corner at Cedar Lane that never received curbs. In addition to this being an aesthetic request, it is also a safety issue as this part of the street narrows considerably as lawns have overtaken the street pavement resulting in a safety issue when cars are parked on the street; vehicles such as fire trucks, ambulances, school buses, trash collection are unable to pass
<P>
Our residents are excited that our turn has finally arrived and that these long waited issues will be addressed.  If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Liz Brennan<BR>
President<BR>
Parkwood Resident’s Association<BR>
