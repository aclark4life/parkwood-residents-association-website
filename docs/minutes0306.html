<B><U>Guest Speaker &#151; Karl Moritz, Researcher, Park and Planning</U></B><BR>
Mr. Moritz made a presentation and fielded question on the new draft of the "Annual
Growth Policy" for Montgomery County.  He distributed a hand-out and explained how
the AGP works to ensure implementation of the "Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance".
This ordinance is in place to ensure that the Planning Board does not approve a
subdivision unless it finds that public facilities are adequate.  He also discussed in detail
the process of tests and reviews a proposed development project must go through to get
approval.  Detailed notes and the hand-out are available from the PRA Secretary.
<P>
As a result of the discussion and presentation, there was a motion to write a letter
supporting the concern of CKC and the Garrett Park Civic Association to maintain the
AGP ceiling element at proposed development at Grosvenor.  The motion was passed.

<B>Gardening Committee</B><BR>
Claire Murphy reported that the Saul Rd. island got a clean-up in April.  She has
contacted the Dept. of Public Works Division of Highway Services in order to get a
rough schedule of the approximately 12 annual mowings the island receives.  This will
enable the committee to organize supplemental maintenance and mowings.<BR>
<B>Directory Committee</B><BR>
The directory is still being planned.  Some contacts have been made regarding
advertising.  125 residents have submitted data.  We may just go with what we have.
<P>
<B><U>President's Update</U></B><BR>
The Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC) meeting in May included a
presentation from Safeway regarding the proposed renovation of the Kensington store.
The project has not yet been approved by Park and Planning.  The expected completion
date is 2005.  The structure will be multi-story like the Giant and Safeway stores in
Bethesda.  The CKC supports a modernized Safeway but wants to see improved traffic
patterns at the intersection of Connecticut and Knowles.
<P>
<B><U>NIH Bioterrorism Facility Update</U></B><BR>
Kira reported that she can no longer be our representative on this issue.  Tom Robertson
will replace her.  The risk assessment is underway, but there are no results yet.  The
project will come before the Planning Board this summer &#151; even before the risk
assessment study is complete.
