Parkwood Garden Club<BR>
History and Five-Year Plan<BR>
<P>
<B>History</B><BR>
<P>
The Parkwood Garden Club has been active in some form since the early days of Parkwood when a handful of neighbors started working on the Saul Road Island. The mature growth that you see now is a product of this first group. Over the years neighbors have maintained the island, some years better than others. As the original group got older, there was a period of time when the island got little attention. However, in the late 1990s a few neighbors started a clean up program. This consisted of severe pruning of overgrown bushes, transplanting others and adding perennials to the area around the sign. In addition, neighbors have been cutting the grass and raking leaves on an as needed basis. In 2002, under the leadership of Parkwood Resident's Association (PRA) President, Liz Brennan, a more formal Garden Club was established with Clare Murphy and Jean Wirsching as co-chairs.

<B>Year 1, 2002 - History and Goals</B>
<P>
<ol type="a">
<li>Established an active Garden Club to assist in island maintenance and continued restoration.</li>
<li>Prepare and present a yearly budget.</li>
<li>Complete the Spring and Fall clean-up:
	<ol type="i">
    <li>Spring clean-up completed consisting of trimming, weeding, edging, mulching and hauling - done by a professional for a cost of $412.00, which was paid partly by PRA and partly by volunteer residents.</li>
    <li>Fall clean up completed consisting of raking and "treating" the large evergreen - paid for by funds remaining in an old Garden Club account.</li><BR>
    </ol></li>
<li>Contacted Montgomery County regarding the county maintenance of all the Parkwood Islands:
	<ol type="i">
    <li>John DiGiovanni, Manager Contracts Unit, Highway Services Division, was contacted for discussion of the poor maintenance of the islands. Mr. DiGiovanni was helpful and the maintenance improved, but grass cutting still needs to be assisted by Parkwood residents.</li><BR>
    </ol></li>
<li>Refurbish the sign at the main entrance of Parkwood
	<ol type="i">
    <li>Monique Bonner cleaned and sanded the sign before painting it black and with gold letters. Her effort took many hours, and all materials were contributed by Monique.</li>
    </ol></li>
</ol>

<P>
<B>Year 2, 2003 - History and Goals</B>
<P>
<ol type="a">
<li>Yearly Budget - $275.00 per year:<BR>
	<ol type="i">
    <li>The Garden Club was assigned a budget of $275.00 per year. This amount barely pays for the yearly spring clean up. Therefore, any remaining work is either paid for by a handful of volunteers or by hours contributed. The county uses $5.50 per hour as a guideline to attach a cost to volunteer work.</li><BR>
    </ol></li>
<li>Garden Club Membership:<BR>
	<ol type="i">
    <li>Membership and interest has dwindled. Clare Murphy continues to do planting and weeding and gathering of neighbors to assist in continued clean up after the major spring clean up.</li><BR>
    </ol></li>
<li>Spring Clean up:
	<ol type="i">
    <li>Completed by outside professional, which takes the majority of the budget.</li>
    <li>Additional work throughout the summer and fall was done and paid for by volunteers, as in 2002.</li>
    </ol></li>
</ol>
