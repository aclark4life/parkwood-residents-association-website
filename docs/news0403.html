<P>
<B><U><BIG>Parkwood to Address Pedestrian Safety Issue</BIG></U></B>  There are several safety problems along the one sidewalk connecting Parkwood to the Grosvenor Metro.  The stretch running along Beach Drive from Franklin is well lit and this year the sidewalk was even plowed.  However, along Rockville Pike between Beech and Tuckerman there is no lighting, the sidewalk wasn’t plowed, and the guardrail protecting pedestrians and cyclists is incomplete.

<B><U><BIG>Garden Committee News</BIG></U></B>  Garden Committee Chairs Jean Wirshing and Claire Murphy have been diligently working with a small group of neighbors to keep the Saul/Cedar island park maintained.  For the past two years the PRA has been able to hire a local landscaper to mulch and prune the area in the fall and spring. Committee members have been planting flowers and providing general maintenance throughout the year. The next focus will be on rehabilitating the islands on Wildwood including removing debris, raking and seeding. The committee chairs are looking for a group of neighbors that is willing to “adopt” this project. Please contact Jean (301-493-8667) if you are able to donate time or funds for the next important step toward Parkwood beautification.

<B><U><BIG>Coalition of Kensington Communities Update</BIG></U></B> The Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC) testified in January in front of the County Council against additional public funding for the Strathmore Concert Hall and urged the Council to tap into private funding to complete the project. The 100,000 million dollar concert hall on Rockville Pike is being built entirely with state and county tax money. The funding for the project was approved in 2001 by the Montgomery County Council with the stipulation that no additional public money was to be used for the capital project. In early February, the County Council voted to provide Strathmore with a 10 year, no interest loan of 6.6 million dollars to complete the project. The concert hall is scheduled to open on the Spring of 2005.
<P>
The CKC has developed a list of Kensington area traffic “hot spots” and is formulating plans to aggressively lobby state and county elected officials and staff at Park and Planning get these traffic problems addressed.  The list of trouble locations include the intersections of Connecticut/Knowles, Connecticut/Plyers Mill and Knowles/Summit. The CKC has also voted to support the Montgomery County Public Schools Capital Improvement Plan budget.
<P>
The CKC is a unified body of 10 area civic associations founded to enhance the quality of life in the Kensington area. Towards this end the group works with local government to address issues of urban design, recreation, transportation, pedestrian accessibility and economic growth affecting greater Kensington. Participation is open to any civic group or governing body in the Kensington area that shares the commitment to improving the welfare of the community.

<B><U><BIG>Property Tax Bill - Check the Math:</BIG></U></B> We have learned through our neighbor resident association Kensington Heights (KH) that some of the arithmetic calculations on the property tax bill are done by . . . HAND!  One KH property owner caught a significant arithmetic error, brought that error to the attention of the appropriate County office, and had her property tax reduced accordingly.  So, be sure to check your property tax bill each year!
