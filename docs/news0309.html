<P>
<h3>Parkwood Provides Comments for AGP Review:</h3>
<P>In July, PRA President Liz Brennan provided comments to
Park and Planning on the proposed changes to the County's Annual Growth Policy. The comments were crafted
based on feedback from members of the community and comments from the June PRA meeting where Planning
Board speaker Carl Mortiz outlined the current policy.
<P>
<B>PRA supports the proposed limit on growth with the suggested limit of 1 percent</B> as a maximum level of over-
all growth for the next several years. The limit is necessary at this time because the rate of growth has outpaced the
revenues needed to provide infrastructure (roads, schools, fire safety, community centers, park maintenance).
<P>
<B>PRA supports a new Developer Impact Tax to be dedicated to schools</B> and supports increasing the current
developer impact tax for traffic. However it is important to recognize that impact taxes will not be able to address
the backlog of infrastructure that is needed.
<P>
<B>PRA requests that building moratoriums be part of the AGP.</B> The draft policy from Park and Planning did not
include a building moratorium option. PRA pointed out that a developer impact tax couldn't address the backlog of
infrastructure issues and that lagging county revenues cannot be relied upon solve the problems either. Many
problem areas in the down county area cannot be solved with funding and the only recourse is a building
moratorium.
<P>
<B>PRA did not support the recommendation of lower developer impact rates for developments close to
transportation efficient areas (Metros).</B> We believe this "tax-break" for developers is shortsighted as all of the
developments provide either residential or commercial parking and therefore funds are needed to address the
additional road capacity needs.
<P>
<B>PRA requested that a reliable school capacity test be crafted.</B> The PRA agreed with the Planning Board that the
current test which "borrows capacity from another school district" needs to be completely abandoned.
<P>
<B>PRA did not support "Special Treatment" for affordable housing</B> developments over the growth cap.
Affordable housing programs should rely on acquiring new space under the growth cap and focus on acquiring
existing space.
PRA was joined by many other communities, including the Town of Rockville and Gaithersburg, the Board of
Education, the Montgomery County PTAs in this process. The final recommendations from Park and Planning can
be found on their web-site. The members of the County Council are currently reviewing these recommendations
and the public has been invited to testify on Sept. 16th and 18th.  The adoption of a new policy is expected in October.
<P>
<B>District 5 Councilman Tom Perez Drafts Impact Tax Legislation for Schools</B>
<P>
District 5 Councilman Tom Perez drafted Impact Tax Legislation last spring. The proposed tax would be dedicated
to new school construction. This legislation is similar to the developer impact tax for traffic. The importance to the
down-county area of this legislation is that it would free county revenues to address construction issues including
modernization of older buildings and additions for overcrowded schools. As the need for new schools up-county
has increased the funding available for older over crowded schools has been delayed. We applaud Mr. Perez for his
leadership on this issue.

<P>
<B>KP</B> has been designated by the Montgomery County Public Schools System (MCPS) as one of three elementary
schools in the county to offer a focus on arts integration as a teaching method. Additionally, KP will host 9 interns
from Maryland University this school year. The interns will be used for differentiation at all grade levels. Average
class size is 24, with the exception of the 4th grade, which has 18 students per class. Over-all enrollment was
projected at 435; actual numbers will be available shortly.
<P>
<B>NB</B> has a new principal, Alton Sumner. Mr. Sumner previously served as Assistant Principal at Wheaton High
School and WJ. Projected enrollment for this school year is 761. More information about North Bethesda can be
found at <A HREF="http://http://www2.mcps.k12.md.us/schools/northbethesdams/">
http://www2.mcps.k12.md.us/schools/northbethesdams/</A>
<P>
<B>WJ</B> was ranked at 45 (out of 100) nationally in a <I>Newsweek Magazine</I> poll: "100 Top Public Schools" this past
June. The ranking is based on the number of students that take advanced placement tests or International
Baccalaureate tests. The on-site modernization continues with the completion of the media center and chemistry
labs. Student enrollment is projected at 1880 this year, however enrollment is currently over 1900 students. More
information about WJ can be found on their website:

<h3>CKC Update:</h3>
<P>The Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC) has been busy the past several months with
several local issues.  At its May meeting representatives from Safeway discussed the proposed renovation project.
The CKC wrote to Park and Planning in general support for a new Safeway but requested that traffic solutions for
the heavily congested corridors of Connecticut Ave/Knowles/Summit/Plyers Mill be addressed as part of the
Safeway project. Park and Planning is still reviewing the plans. The CKC voted to support the Developer Impact
Tax for Schools legislation sponsored by Council-member Tom Perez. The CKC will provide comments on the
draft Annual Growth Policy to the County Council at the hearing on September 16th.
<P>
The CKC is a unified body of 11 area civic associations founded to enhance the quality of life in the
Kensington area. Towards this end the group works with local government to address issues of urban
design, recreation, transportation, pedestrian accessibility and economic growth affecting greater
Kensington. Participation is open to any civic group or governing body in the Kensington area that shares
the commitment to improving the welfare of the community.

<H3>Approved Residential Projects in the Walter Johnson Cluster:</H3>
<P>The chart below provides an overview
of new residential construction in the North Bethesda area. This is of particular interest to Parkwood
residents as all of these projects are districted to Walter Johnson High School.  While MCPS had
projected 1880 students for this school year, currently over 1900 students are enrolled at WJ. Educators
agree that a learning environment of this size is not optimal. Members of the WJ PTA are closely
watching the impact of new residential development.

<B>Wheaton Revitalization Update:</B> The first phase of the re-development of the Westfield's Shopping Town
(Wheaton Plaza) is on schedule and the following stores are due to open in September: Giant, Starbucks, Quizznos,
Wachovia Bank and Nextel.
<P>
<B>Town of Kensington News - Cement Factory Owner Proposes Land Swap:</B> For those that missed the article in
The Gazette (July 16), the owner of the cement factory in the Town of Kensington (Metropolitan Ave.) has
petitioned the county for a land swap.  Cement factory owner, Mr. Gould, has proposed to swap his property (the
old cement factory) with property up-county. The upshot of this deal could be that instead of the 250-space parking
lot that the county has planned, there could be the possibility of additional retail space. The proposal is currently in
the County Executive's office and no decision has been made.
