<B>LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen:
<P>
Five feet of snow, and now we know, how it feels to live in Buffalo…New York that is.  It took them a while, but in the end, the county did an extraordinary job with snow removal in Parkwood.  As a number of streets were never plowed following the December 19th storm, I still await confirmation that county officials have remapped these streets to place them on their snow removal grid.
<P>
This winter’s snow was unprecedented and it did a number on the neighborhood.  Many community curbs have been broken and gardens have been damaged.  If you know of a concrete curb that has been damaged or broken, please notify me at blcon350@verizon.net, so that I can send a comprehensive list to the county to facilitate their timely repair.  The Beautification Committee will need extra volunteers and time this spring to put things back in shape.  Both the Saul Road and Wildwood gardens have suffered and if you can help, please let us know.
<P>
One of the primary objectives for the next meeting will be election of officers to serve on the PRA Board.  These positions are all held by volunteers whom have served at least two years, some have served many more.  If you would like to volunteer for the office of president, vice-president, treasurer, secretary, or membership chairman, then you should attend the meeting and be prepared to deliver a short synopsis describing yourself and why you would like to contribute your time to serving Parkwood.  This should take about five minutes for each office seeker.  The floor will be opened for discussion and elections will then be held.
<P>
Other items on the agenda include discussion and approval of a draft PRA budget for 2010; a discussion on the pros and cons of annexation of Parkwood by the Town of Kensington; reports by various committees and coalitions; and discussions on a neighborhood block party and yard sale.
<P>
We hope to see you there.
<P>
Bailey Condrey<br>
PRA President</BIG>

<U><B>ELECTION OF PRA OFFICERS</B></U>
<P>
The PRA will elect officers at the next meeting.  The board and committee chair positions shake out in the following manner at present:
<ul>
<li>Bailey Condrey, the current president, would like to remain in office, as a number of rather complicated issues still confront the neighborhood.  But should a volunteer wish to assume this office, then we will hold an election.</li>
<li>Julie Tierney, the current vice president would like to conclude her service.</li>
<li>Gerald Sharp, the current treasurer has indicated that he would like to remain in office, but should another volunteer wish to assume these duties, then we will hold an election.</li>
<li>Maryann Dillon, the current secretary would like to conclude her service.</li>
<li>Kitty Stone, the current membership chairwoman would like to conclude her service in June 2010.  The PRA would like another volunteer to assume these duties.</li>

    <B>VOLUNTEER SPOTLIGHT</B><br>
	Volunteers are responsible for the home delivery of the PRA newsletter and they undertake this effort at least three times each year.  They provide an invaluable service in keeping the community informed, ensuring that residents without access to the list serv stay abreast of Parkwood issues.  I’d like to extend the deep appreciation of the Parkwood Board to these volunteers, many of whom have helped for several years.  New volunteers are shown in parenthesis.  We give a hearty round of thanks to the following residents:

<P>
<B><I>White Flint Sector Plan: </I></B>Through its membership in the Coalition of Kensington Communities (CKC) and the White Flint Community Coalition, the Parkwood Residents Association has been focused on the White Flint Sector Plan since last fall.  These groups have met with, and submitted comments to, the members of the County Council and their staff to voice concerns about planned density, traffic, and lack of planned infrastracture and community amenities for current and future residents.  As of the time of printing of this newsletter, the Council’s comment period on the Sector Plan had closed and a vote was planned for March 23.  The details on the entire plan can be found at: <A HREF="http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/community/whiteflint/">http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/community/whiteflint/</A>
