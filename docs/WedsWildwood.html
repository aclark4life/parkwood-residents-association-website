Are you the neighbor whose schedule allows just an hour or two this summer to ‘donate’ to the beautification efforts?
<P>
Do you or your friends need community service credits before school starts back up?
<P>
Maybe you are looking for a way to bring your block of neighbors together for an evening outside?
<P>
If you like to dig in the dirt, plant things or just move mulch, I have the project for you.  Join the Parkwood Resident Association Beautification Committee on Wednesday evenings at the Wildwood Island at the intersection of Saul Rd.   We will be there after 5:30 PM each Wed in Aug to finish work mulching trees (digging borders, moving & spreading mulch) and begin planting the mulched end of the island with native plants.  Join us for one evening or every week – whatever fits your schedule.
<P>
Bring bug spray, work gloves and any tools you have handy.  We will go from there.
<P>
If you have perennials that need to be thinned or want to get rid of some plants, give me a shout.  We are looking for native species that are deer resistant to help populate the end of Wildwood Island.
<P>
I look forward to seeing you or hearing from you soon.   Please share this information with others in our neighborhood who might not be members of the list serve, as this message is only being sent electronically to the Parkwood list serve members.  Thanks.
<P>
