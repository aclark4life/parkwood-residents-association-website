Mr. Arthur Holmes, Jr. <br>
Chairman <br>
Montgomery County Planning Board <br>
8787 Georgia Avenue <br>
Silver Spring, MD 20910<br>

<p>
Dear Mr. Holmes:
<P>
On behalf of the Parkwood Resident's Association, I am writing to support the modernization of the Kensington
Parkwood Elementary School.  At approximately 50 years old the current building is too small and dilapidated
to serve this community's needs. The site currently has 4 portable classrooms and is scheduled to get 2 more
this fall.
<p>
The current plans takes into account important improvements as well as respecting the neighborhood, including:
<ul>
<li>Adequate educational space, configured to facilitate evolving instructional strategies such as re-
grouping of students among classrooms;

<li>Configuration that promotes student safety and security within the building and on the
playgrounds;

<li>Safe access for students, whether they travel by bus, car, or foot;

<li>Respect for the scale of the neighborhood and style of the neighborhood;

<li>Preservation of the park-like setting of the school, including retention of old growth trees,
minimization of impervious spaces, and preservation to the extent possible of the contours of the
site.
</ul>
<P>
The site plan was developed after a series of eight public hearings, including one all-day design session to
hammer out a final site plan with specific representation of neighbors from each side of the site.  While, as the
Parkwood Residents'Association vote demonstrates, the plan has not been universally acclaimed, it represents a
compromise among competing interests that satisfies the majority of the community, and is evidence of the
considerable effort the community has made to come to agreement on this issue.
<P>
Finally, I understand the Planning Board delayed approval of the plan pending further consideration of tree
preservation strategies.  I cannot stress strongly enough the need to complete the modernization project as soon
as possible. It is important to remember that the KP site is, first and foremost, a school site and the current
building is woefully inadequate to meet the needs of the current or future enrollment of this school.
<P>
Thank you for this opportunity to communicate this information.
<P>
Sincerely,<br><br>

Elizabeth Brennan<br>
President<br>
Parkwood Residents Association
