<P>
To whom it may concern,
<P>
The Parkwood Residents Association (PRA) is made up of 900 homes
located off Cedar Lane east of Rockville Pike. As a result of the
location of our neighborhood, the state of traffic on Rockville Pike/
Wisconsin Ave and Cedar Lane is of concern to the residents since
these are major routes that we have to traverse to reach our homes
and conduct our lives. Traffic on these routes is already so heavy
that there are times of the day when movement in the area is nearly
impossible. Therefore, the potential increase in traffic due not only
to the additional employees to be moved to NNMC, but also due to the
additional traffic from outpatient visits, is not acceptable.
<P>
In addition, as president of PRA I object to the short notice given
to the various neighborhood residents associations in the area that
comments on the EIS would be due on January 4, 2007. I received
notice from the Department of the Navy on December 12, 2006 that this
process was beginning, with meetings starting that very day. Most
meetings for comments on the EIS were held the week before Christmas.
Because of the short notice, the PRA has not had a chance to meet and
discuss the EIS issue. Our meetings are held four times a year at
which time we also publish a newsletter informing residents of issues
of interest. Only 30% of our residents are on the PRA listserve,
making it impossible for us to discuss the Navy EIS and to take a
position on it as an organization. The period for solicitation of
public comments on the EIS, which was less than one month, was not
sufficient.
<P><BR>
