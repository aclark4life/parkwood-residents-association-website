Dear Mr. Shanaman:
<P>
On behalf of the Parkwood Resident’s Association, I would like to share our position on the proposed renovation of the Kensington Safeway. The membership met and discussed the project several times last year. At the December meeting the members voted to send a letter that reflects support of a new modernized Safeway.  Our membership also felt it important to acknowledge the smaller businesses in the Kensington shopping district and would encourage that the Safeway project not duplicate services that are already being offered.
<P>
The Parkwood Resident’s Association was incorporated in 1987 and serves approximately 918 homes in the Kensington area and is bordered by Parkwood Drive, Cedar Lane and Westbrook Street.
<P>
If you have any questions regarding our position or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
<P>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
Elizabeth Brennan<BR>
President<BR>
