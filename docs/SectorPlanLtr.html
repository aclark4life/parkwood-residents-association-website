Re:  Kensington Sector Plan
<P>
Dear Council President Praisner and the Montgomery County Council:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parkwood Residents Association (PRA) is an active and diverse association of about 900 single-family homes located southwest of the Town of Kensington.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PRA strongly believes that it is vital for the long overdue Kensington Sector Plan process to continue to completion in the Spring of 2008. Through representation in the Coalition of Kensington Communities, PRA has been lobbying Park & Planning for several years to begin this process, which was last reviewed in 1978.  We have already had a successful kick-off meeting at the Kensington Town Hall on March 21. This event was well attended by citizens from many of the neighborhoods around the Town of Kensington, and it is vital that the energy generated at that meeting be channelled into a successful Sector Plan review for Kensington.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRA respectfully requests the County Council to provide to Park & Planning the support that is needed to move the Kensington Sector Plan forward this year.
<P>
