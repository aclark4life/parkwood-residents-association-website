<B><U><BIG>Citizens Against Beltway Expansion (CABE) to Present at 6/7 PRA Meeting</BIG></U></B>
<P>
Those attending our March 21 meeting know we had a spirited discussion about current studies to widen the Beltway.  PRA members passed a motion at that meeting to oppose Beltway expansion, and authorized the PRA to send a representative, Marion Woods-Lubbert, to attend the next meeting of Citizens Against Beltway Expansion, or CABE (formerly called the Rock Creek Coalition), an association of civic groups adjacent to the Beltway in Montgomery County.  That meeting is to be held May 30, and we will have a full update at our June 7 meeting.
<P>
Joe Davies of CABE was unable to attend our March 21 meeting, and so will provide an update at our June 7 meeting.  Sue Rajan, Project Manager of the Capital Beltway Project of the Maryland Department of Transportation, was invited to attend as well, but informed us that MDOT is in the middle of some studies and will not be ready for any public presentations until Spring 2007.
<P>
As way of background, the Maryland State Highway Administration is studying a plan to widen the road to ten lanes, of which four would be toll lanes built and managed by a private company.  On January 24, County Council President George L. Leventhal and Council Member Steven A. Silverman joined CABE in a press conference to express firm opposition to Beltway widening.  Council members Floreen and  Perez have also expressed strong support for CABE’s position.  <I>For more information, please visit the PRA website at <A HREF="http://www.parkwoodresidents.org">www.parkwoodresidents.org</A>
and download both the State Highway Administration report and link to the CABE website.</I>
<P>
<B><U><BIG>President’s Message:</BIG></U></B>
<P>
As those of you who attended the PRA meeting in March know, I was elected president primarily because no one else volunteered to take the job. The lack of volunteers was rather surprising, since there are many talented people in Parkwood. Perhaps there was just a feeling in the community that it would be hard to follow Liz Brennan, who has so ably and enthusiastically revived the PRA over the past years. Liz offered to do some hand holding in getting me started, and
also to continue to be in charge of issues relating to politics and Kensington-Parkwood school, for which I am most grateful. I value the PRA, and didn't want to see it fade away. To me the spirit of our neighborhood comes through especially well in the listserve, on which many of us exchange information that benefits all of us. If you haven't joined, I encourage you to do so. The Parkwood web site, maintained by Peter Mansbach, is also a great resource with links to sites all of us need at various times.
<P>
I became a resident of Parkwood in 1967 when my husband and I bought our house at 10112 Wildwood Road. At that time, Dresden Street went from Cedar Lane to the corner of Wildwood, and there were woods behind our house. I worked for 43 years at the NIH, where I was a biochemist doing basic research. I joined the PRA to make Parkwood aware of plans by NIH to build a facility for bioterrorism research, which I believed would be more appropriately placed in a less populated area than ours, and I represented PRA on the NIH Community Liason Council for several years. In spite of our and many other neighborhood protests, that building is scheduled to open soon, but our efforts did result in considerable enhancements to the safety of Bldg 33. Since I retired in April 2005, I have been able to enjoy being a full-time gardener. This was one reason I volunteered to collect information on trees in Parkwood that needed attention for various reasons, including wire issues, and many of you send me e-mails about your trees. The response of various parties (PEPCO, Verizon, Comcast, Montgomery County) to these issues has been less than impressive, but are still works in progress. In the future we have a number of issues of concern to the neighborhood that we hope to discuss at one of our quarterly meetings, including Beltway widening, traffic control in the neighborhood, and lingering problems at the new school building. I hope to see you at the meetings and welcome your input.<BR>

<B><U><BIG>Circle Manor Update</BIG></U></B>
<P>
Montgomery County and the Town of Kensington held a public meeting in May to discuss options for preserving Circle Manor in historic Kensington, now that the County has agreed to purchase the property through its Legacy Open Space program.    While there is no consensus on redeveloped uses, citizens expressed desires to preserve the historic structures and green space.  The Montgomery County Planning Board has not yet voted on any plans for redevelopment.  Citizens have expressed opposition to redevelopment into affordable or senior housing, a restaurant, or mixed use such as a bed and breakfast. Given the extensive rehabilitation needs of the property, coupled with limited uses likely to be supported and the costs of ongoing maintenance, developing economically viable plans for this property will continue to be a challenge.
<P>
<B><U><BIG>2006 Highway Mobility Report:</BIG></U></B>
<P>
Montgomery County Park & Planning just completed the 2006 Highway Mobility Report (formerly known as the Annual Development and Congestion Report). It's the third year of this report which identifies the most congested intersections in the County. Connecticut Avenue at University is ranked eighth most congested, up from 62nd in 2005, a result of increased volumes in both directions. Here is the link to the report: <A HREF="http://www.mc-mncppc.org/Transportation/hmr/index.shtm">http://www.mc-mncppc.org/Transportation/hmr/index.shtm</A>

<B><U><BIG>Renew Montgomery Program:</BIG></U></B>
<P>
On March 19, Liz Brennan, outgoing President of the PRA, sent the following letter to Thomas Pogue of Montgomery County Department of Public Works. Excerpts are as follows:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Dear Mr. Pogue:
<P>
The Parkwood Residents Association was formally notified by the County about the Renew Montgomery Program in March 2005. We have gone through a thoughtful and deliberate evaluation process including discussions at our meetings and notifications in our newsletter.  On behalf of the Parkwood Residents I am pleased to submit the following for consideration under the Renew Montgomery Program:
<P>
<B>Pedestrian Safety:</B> With the completion of the Grosvenor Metro parking lot, Parkwood has experienced an increased amount of high-speed cut through traffic, most especially on Saul Road. We are requesting additional stop signs at the intersections of Saul and Wildwood and Saul and Woodfield… Crosswalks are needed at…Cedar Lane & Clearbrook, Dresden, Everett, Franklin, Glenridge and Delmont.
<B>Tree Maintenance:</B> The attached spreadsheet provides information on street trees that are touching service lines. Please note that the lines are not PEPCO as we have had them out to Parkwood twice this past year to trim trees that were touching their lines…<BR>
<B>Traffic Gridlock:</B> As a result of the new Grosvenor Metro lot we are now experiencing significantly increased traffic headed north on Beech Drive toward Rockville Pike…. We would like a slight roadway widening so that there is a dedicated lane to go north on Rockville Pike (toward the new Metro lot/Strathmore, etc) from Beech Drive this bottleneck would be somewhat relieved.<BR>
<B>Storm Water Drainage</B> is an issue at the corner of Beech Drive and Franklin Street
<P>
Our residents are excited that our turn has finally arrived and that these long waited issues will be addressed.  If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
<P>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>
Liz Brennan<BR>
President<BR>
Parkwood Residents Association<BR>
<BR>
Cc: Doug Duncan, County Executive<BR>

<B><U><BIG>Election 2006 – High Voter Turnout Essential for Parkwood</BIG></U></B>
<P>
The upcoming election this fall is an extremely important one for Parkwood residents. In addition to the higher level offices such as State Governor, US Senate & Congress there are local county elections the result of which will definitely impact our quality of life as residents.   A large voter turnout for Parkwood is essential as we vie with others for county resources. Elected officials are keenly aware of which neighborhoods have a high voter turnout. The Primary is September 12th and the General Election is November 7th.  The Parkwood polling place will revert back to the Kensington Parkwood Elementary School.
