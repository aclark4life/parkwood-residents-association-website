<br>
</font><font size="3">Thanks to all of the folks that attended the March
12th meeting. With over 60 people in attendance it was a huge success.<br>
<B><U><br>
Communication Tool: List-Serve Available:</U> <U> </U></B>The most exciting
news is that we have already created a listserve to assist with communication .
This should  greatly enhance our ability to inform residents about upcoming
meetings, post minutes from past meetings and share issues of relevance to the
Parkwood Community.  It should also serve as a great tool to facilitate
committee work.  To subscribe to the listserve, send an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">parkwoodresidents-
subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>.
Many thanks to Heidi Lipson for volunteering to set-up this list-serve and
doing it so quickly. <br>
<br>
<B><U>Block Captains Needed:</U></B> Kathy Byars has volunteered to chair the
Block Captain Committee. If you are interested in helping out, please contact
Kathy at 301-530-9441. Block Captains will be responsible for providing print
copies of important flyers/information to those Parkwood residents that do not
have access to the list-serve and to identify newcomers to the Welcoming
Committee. <br>
<br>
<B><U>PRA 2002 Meeting Schedule:</U> </B>At the March meeting, it was decided
to increase the PRA membership meetings from 2 to 4 annually. The dates for the
meetings for the rest of this year are: June12th, September 17th and December
10th. We will be meeting at new location, the Kensington Parkwood Elementary
School. It was determined that the cost to rent this room was similar to the
library, and offers the option for many of us to walk to the meetings.<br>
<br>
<B><U>Membership Information Needed: </U></B>Attached to this flyer is a <a
href="../SURVEY.doc">survey and membership application</a>. If you have not
already completed these important forms, please take the time to fill them out
and return them to PRA Treasurer, Chris St. Clair at 4616 Saul Rd., Kensington,
20895.<br>
<br>
<B><U>Committee News:</U> </B>One of the goals of the March meeting was to
resurrect many of the more active committees the PRA has benefited from in the
past and to identify new activities for the neighborhood. We have had many
volunteers step forward and still are in need of volunteers. Below are the
current committee chairs, if you are interested in participating, please
contact them. We have tabulated the survey from the newsletter and have lots of
people interested and energized to start new programs from book club to creek
clean-up days. If you can volunteer to chair one of the many
activities/events/issues listed in the survey, please contact either Liz
Brennan 3/530-3615 or Jan Rothman so that you can get the list of interested
neighbors and begin planning.<br>

Forum for District 5 in Montgomery County. District 5, which includes the

Berlage is stepping down and there are currently three candidates running for
this position: Cynthia Rubenstein, Tom Perez and Sally Sternbach all from the
Silver Spring area.  The Forum will be a question and answer format with
questions developed and posed by the CKC.  If you are interested in
