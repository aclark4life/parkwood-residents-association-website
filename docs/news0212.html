<B><I>The next PRA meeting will be held on Tuesday, December 10th
at 7:30 pm in the All- Purpose room at KP Elementary School.
Please contact me if you have any items that you would like placed
on the agenda.</I></B>
<P>
A lot has happened in the Kensington area since we last met in early September.
With the sniper activity, the attempted child abduction and the recent car
theft, it is important, maybe now more than ever to come together as a
neighborhood to share information, get to know one another and to advocate on
behalf of our community for services.
<P>
<B>President's Report:</B> In September I testified before Park and Planning regarding
the proposed modernization of the neighborhood school, Parkwood Elementary.
With the unsightly portable classrooms mushrooming around the school property,
(with more on the way!) it is imperative that the school is modernized to
accommodate the capacity problem as quickly as possible.
<P>
I also testified in November before Park and Planning regarding the "mixed-use"
development that is proposed for the White Flint Metro site on Rockville Pike.
I had several concerns about this project, the first and foremost the traffic
impacts to our community as we attempt to navigate Rockville Pike. Another
issue I had regarded the removal of recreational and green space. Currently
there is a golf driving range and putt-putt facility at this location. I
believe we are in dire straits with regard to disappearing green space and lack
of recreational facilities down county. I took this opportunity to question the
benefit to area residents of this proposed development that would include four
office buildings and four apartment buildings all 20 stories in height.
<P>
I have made several requests to the developer of the Grosvenor Metro site to
provide Parkwood with a presentation on this project. No response yet, but I
hope to have information by the Dec. meeting.
<P>
The <B>Coalition of Kensington Communities</B> adopted the PRA Dog Leash Resolution
with minor modifications. They deliberated on the proposed bioterrorism
facility at NIH but chose not to take a position at the November meeting, but
will discuss this topic again at the January meeting. The CKC testified in
front of County Council against an amendment to the Annual Growth Policy that
would facilitate and accelerate the Georgetown Prep. housing project. The group
also discussed different approaches to traffic management in Kensington area,
the use of radar speed cameras where traffic calming is needed, update on
Connecticut Ave. sidewalk issue, and the Inner Purple Line Conn Ave. crossing.
CKC representatives met with Park and Planning Chair Derick Berlage regarding
the desire to have a recreational type community center after the Housing
Opportunities Commission departs the building on Summit Ave.
<P>
The next <B>PRA Book Club</B> meeting is January 5th in the evening. The book is Meg
Greenfield's Washington. RSVP to Karen Luckyer at 301-530-8311 if you are
interested in participating.
<P>
The <B>Babysitting Co-op</B> group is meeting on December 11th at 8:00 pm at Valerie
Gottron's home: 4624 Saul Rd. All interested neighbors are invited to attend.
<P>
<B>Parkwood Residents Association Directory:</B> The PRA Directory Committee, having
discussed via e-mail the issues and concerns surrounding a neighborhood
directory, has concluded that such a directory would serve a number of useful
purposes, including enabling neighbors to identify babysitters and potential
playmates for their children; organize community events such as yard sales or
block parties; and simply get to know one another. At the September meeting the
following was agreed upon by the membership:
<P>
We will produce a directory that will include information on every house in the
Parkwood neighborhood. The minimum information to be included will be address,
names of adults in residence, and home telephone number. Other information that
will be included at the request of residents will be e-mail addresses; work
telephone numbers; fax numbers: and children's names, ages, grades, and schools
attended. The directory will be distributed to every house in the neighborhood.
Production of the directory will be paid for through advertising.
<P>
<B><I>Unresolved issues:</I></B>
<ul>
<li>Is there other information that would be useful in such a directory?
<li>Are there any printers among the membership who would be interested in
  bidding on the job?
</ul>
Please contact Kitty Stone if you have any questions and/or suggestions,
301-564-9574 or <A HREF="mailto:castone3@aol.com">castone3@aol.com</A>.
<P>
<B>Join the PRA List Serve:</B> In order to provide a constant source of communication
for the Parkwood Community, an E-Mail group was created. The e-mail group is
open to all residents of the Parkwood subdivision who have an e-mail address.
To subscribe to the e-mail group, send a blank message to:
<A HREF="mailto:parkwoodresidents-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">

You will receive a confirmation message when you are
subscribed. Do not write anything in the subject or body of the message. It
will not be seen by anyone and you will not get a response. This communication
mode can save the PRA funds if we can get encourage all to participate! Sign on
