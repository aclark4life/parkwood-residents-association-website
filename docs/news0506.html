<B><U>President’s Message</U></B>
<P>
At the last PRA meeting (March 21<SUP>st</SUP>
) I overheard this comment: "I can’t believe how much is going on in this area." This was after the meeting in which we discussed:
<ul>
<li>The modernization at Kensington Parkwood Elementary</li>
<li>WSCC project (scheduled to plow under Parkwood)</li>
<li>Beltway widening project</li>
<li>new development in North Bethesda (White Flint Crossing project)</li>
<li>Kensington revitalization</li>
<li>ASHA development</li>
</ul>
The good news is that these projects listed above and others impacting our area allow for community input. The bad news is that they are being covered by a small group of volunteers from Parkwood. <I>We need more residents to volunteer their time to monitor local projects that impact our neighborhood.</I> On average these volunteer opportunities take several hours a month of your time. We need people to attend meetings, report back to the community and when appropriate voice the PRA position on projects. We are currently in need of people to monitor and represent the PRA for the proposed Beltway widening project, Kensington revitalization and a liaison for the <I>Renew Montgomery</I> program. Please contact me at <A HREF="mailto:brennanhouse@verizon.net">brennanhouse@verizon.net</A>
or 301-530-3615 if you are  interested in serving.
<P>
It seems appropriate at this time to also thank the many residents that currently do volunteer: Maryann Dillon, Chris St. Clair, Brenda Marshall, Bill Zwack, Tom Robertson, Paula Flicker, Kathy Byars, Kitty Stone, Peter Mansbach, Heidi Lipson, Jan Thomas, Claire Murphy, Jean Wirsching and Peter Galvin.
<P>
Hope to see you June 6,
Liz Brennan
<P>
<B><U>Renew Montgomery Coming to Parkwood</U></B>
<P>
Parkwood has been selected for the County’s FY2005 <I>Renew Montgomery</I> Program to repair deteriorated sidewalks, curbs and gutters as well as to make other infrastructure refurbishments. While in our neighborhood, the Department of Public Works and Transportation (DPWT) can coordinate other appropriate activities including:
<ul>
<li>Sidewalk, curb and gutter repair</li>
<li>Roadways base repairs and resurfacing</li>
<li>ADA improvements</li>
<li>Traffic calming</li>
<li>Street lighting</li>
<li>Sign and marking maintenance</li>
<li>Bus stop amenities</li>
<li>Tree maintenance and neighborhood beautification</li>
<li>Storm drain improvements</li>
</ul>
We can use this opportunity presented by the county to address issues that have been mentioned by many residents over the past several years. This is our chance to advocate and coordinate for neighborhood enhancements. We’re looking for feedback from the residents as to what and where they feel improvements should be made AND volunteers to shepherd this effort. This will be an agenda item for the June meeting.
<P>
<B><U>WSSC Water Main Update</U></B>
<P>
Those of you who attended our March members' meeting heard a report from Bill Zwack and Tom Robertson, our PRA representatives on the WSSC Community Advisory Committee, on WSSC's proposed plans to construct a large water main from Tuckerman Lane to Beach Drive near the Mormon Temple.  WSSC has essentially narrowed its choices of possible "alignments" (for running a 7-foor diameter water supply pipe 150 to 300 feet below ground) to the following three tunneling scenarios: 1) under Saul Road, 2) under Rock Creek Park and/or Beach Drive (along the Beltway), or 3) under Beach Drive north of the 355 access road to under Knowles Avenue.  In other words, the alignment involving the defacing of Rock Creek Park above ground is virtually off the table.  For a tunneling alignment, three vertical shafts will be drilled...one at each end and one in the middle, possibly removing one acre of trees in Rock Creek Park near the 355 access to Beach Drive.  Also, geophysical testing (surface probes and soil sample boring) will occur on and off starting in May along the three tunneling alignments.
<P>
As tunneling 150 to 300 feet below either Saul Road, Rock Creek/Beach Drive, or Beach Drive/Knowles Avenue are the likely scenarios for the new 7-foot-diameter water supply pipeline by WSSC, you may notice crews in and around the neighborhood for another week or two performing geophysical testing.  This testing is minimally disruptive and involves laying wires for 1,000 feet in a straight line, with probes into the ground every 20 feet or so.  There will not be loud noises, excavation, or traffic disruption.  <I>As it is a concern of many residents, it appears that at this time the WSSC scenarios to "cut and cover" a pipe through Rock Creek Park (15 feet below the surface) is virtually off the table.</I> However, the deeper tunneling scenarios mentioned above will likely require a 1-acre clearing of trees in the park for a vertical shaft.
<P>
<B><U>KP Elementary School  Modernization Landscaping</U></B>
<P>
At the March meeting the landscaping plans for KPES were displayed for community perusal and discussed briefly. PRA representatives Bill Zwack and Liz Brennan met with Parks and Planning (P&amp;P) after concerns had been raised about a variety of issues including proposed trees on the sledding hill and border foliage.  MCPS agreed to relocate (on-site) the approximately 17 trees that were planned for the sledding hill. They also agreed to revisit the plans for screening the building from the bordering residences. Additionally MCPS agreed to address ground cover concerns if it turns out that grass is unable to grow due to the amount of trees to be planted. A copy of the landscape design will be available again at the June PRA meeting.
<P>
<B><U>Parkwood and the Beltway</U></B>
<P>
PRA has been active over the years, working with other neighborhood associations to oppose adding additional lanes to that part of the Beltway (495) that runs adjacent to the neighborhood and through Rock Creek Park  In particular, Parkwood has been a founding and active member of the Rock Creek Coalition which includes neighborhoods along both sides of the beltway from Rockville Pike over to Colesville, and worked cooperatively with the Action Committee for Transit whose focus is on adding light rail (trolley) cars instead of adding more lanes for cross-county traffic.
<P>
Originally, putting the beltway through the park was controversial, and promises were made to limit the size.  Subsequently those promises were forgotten and additional lanes added.  Parkwood and other neighborhoods along this stretch of the beltway have opposed further expansion – to limit noise, pollution, and impact on the park.  Nevertheless, the Maryland Highway Administration continues to be interested in adding lanes to both 495 and 270.  Virginia has recently decided to go ahead and do so south of the bridge.  Various residents have taken the lead on this issue over time and we're looking for fresh blood.  Please help your neighborhood and give Liz Brennan a call to volunteer!

<P>
Thank you to all the members who contributed to the PRA Beautification Committee. The Committee and, we're sure, all the members and residents appreciate your generosity. We’ll put the funds to good use in implementing our Five Year Plan. And, as always, we're eager to have more volunteers help with the maintenance work, particularly in the summer months.  The more volunteers we get, the further our funds go. We'll discuss the budget and the plans for this year at the June 6th meeting.<BR>

<B><U>Parkwood Neighborhood Directory is Ready!</U></B>
<P>
Many thanks to Jan Thomas, who has completed a draft copy of the 2005 Parkwood Neighborhood Directory, with help from the PRA.  The directory includes names and addresses of Parkwood households which are available from public records.  You may recall receiving a postcard from Jan several months back about this project.  Many residents sent Jan additional information, such as email addresses or special services, to include under their names.  Others requested that their names be withheld, which Jan has done.  Reference numbers for key County services and your PRA board members are also included. On May 14, Jan hosted a neighborhood get-together to share the draft.  Congratulations to Jan Rothman who submitted the winning entry photo to be used on the cover of the final copy!  Watch out for the final copy which will be delivered in the next month or so.  Hats off to Jan Thomas for putting together this fantastic neighborhood resource!

Did you know it costs upward of $300 to mail this newsletter?  Thanks to Chair <I>Paula Flicker</I> and her team of block captains, PRA can save this cost (and keep your membership fees down!) by having volunteers deliver door-to-door.  This is a huge undertaking that involves lots of coordination… and lots of volunteers. So here are the folks who make this possible:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Annelise Hafer * Robert Paxton * Katie Engen * Marie Eibel * David Flumbaum * Sandra Falzone * Sandra Cepaitis * Matt and Liz Grandonico * Cathie Flynn * Carol Hall * Tricia Gill * Roger Ashland * Katie Brennan * Debbie Blumenthal * Ann Mahoney * Tammy Stuckey * John Aronson and Marta Lowe * Charlotte Taylor * Peggy Regnier * Laura Roberts * Laura Akinbami * Scott and Cheryl Imirie * Shari Tavel * Beth Israel * Al Del Grosso * Lynn Weidenschilling * Diana Mears * Barbara Wilson * Mary Brown * Becky Johnson * Kathy Byars</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
