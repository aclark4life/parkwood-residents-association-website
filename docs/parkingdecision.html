PROPOSED CREATION OF RESIDENTIAL<br>
PERMIT PARKING IN PARKWOOD_KENSINGTON RESIDENTIAL AREA<br><br><br>
<CENTER>
<B>STATEMENT OF DECISION OF COUNTY EXECUTIVE</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Having considered the Report and Recommendation of the Hearing Officer in the matter
of the Residential Permit Parking Petition for the east side of Saul Road between Franklin Street
and Oldfield Drive, for the reasons stated in the Report and Recommendation, it is my
determination that the permit parking petition should be granted and a residential permit parking
area created. The area in which residential permit parking is to be created is limited to the east
side of Saul Road between Franklin Street and Oldfleld Drive as stated in the petition.
This decision is to take effect in sixty (60) days. I am further asking that the Department make
another effort to work with the Montgomery County Public Schools and the Montgomery
County Planning Board to come up with a better solution that would alleviate the need for permit
parking.
