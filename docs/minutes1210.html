<P>
Old Business – The minutes of the April 17th PRA meeting were approved.
<P>
State Delegate Al Carr spoke about the legislative options for improving PEPCO’s Reliability and how homeowners and civic groups can get involved.
<P>
Lara Akinbami and Bailey Condrey provided an update on the improvements that PRA requested of Montgomery County to increase nighttime illumination of certain areas within the neighborhood.  This included a number of street corners, bus stops and park entrances.  Unfortunately, the county provided many more lights than were requested, even though Parkwood provided specific pole numbers where lights were needed.  They also missed a couple of requests in spite of being given a map.
<P>
PRA Treasurer Gerald Sharp updated the community on budget matters and laid out the 2012 proposed budget.  He informed the members that PRA achieved record membership and large donations to beautification. The budget for the 2012 calendar year was approved by the membership.
 <P>
Gail Dalferes provided a rundown of 2012 beautification projects and reviewed completed projects to date. She provided information on a project proposed by MNCPPC to remove invasive bamboo on parkland running east from the intersection of Franklin and Beach Drives.  Beautification projects were approved in the budget.
<P>
Lara Akinbami and Gail Dalferes reviewed recent developments with the Kensington Sector Plan and stated that a public hearing on ZTA 12-06 (zoning text amendment) would be held in the near future.  Date TBD.
<P>
The PRA held Executive Committee Elections for the posts of Vice President and Welcoming Committee Chair.  Lara Akinbami ran uncontested for Vice President.  Valerie Gottron ran uncontested for Welcoming Committee Chairperson. Both were elected to these offices, which run until spring 2014. There were no candidates seeking the office of secretary.  The post remains unfilled.  The other officers remain in place.
<P>
New Business included discussions about redesign of the membership magnet for dues renewal, block parties and a yard sale.  No decisions were made.  The meeting adjourned at 9:34 p.m.
