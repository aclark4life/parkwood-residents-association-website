<I>PRA is joining the Montgomery County Civic Federation, a county-wide nonprofit educational and advocacy organization founded in 1925 to serve the public interest.  Many neighborhood associations are members. Liz Brennan will be the PRA representative to the Federation. The monthly Federation meetings are open to the public and held on the second Monday of each month, September through June at 7:45 p.m. in the First Floor Auditorium, County Office Building, Rockville, MD.</I>

<B><U><BIG>PRA President’s Report: <I>Successful Rock Creek Park Clean-up</I></BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
The PRA was happy to accept the invitation of Mark Curry of Cub Scouts Pack 460 to participate in a clean-up of Rock Creek Park adjacent to Parkwood on April 21, 2007. Fortunately, the day was about as perfect as a Spring day could be, and Nature further rewarded us by carpeting the Park with wildflowers.  The Virginia Bluebells, in particular, formed a sea of bright blue, mirroring the cloudless blue sky as we picked our way through the woods gathering an astounding amount of junk. There were over 230 participants this year, compared to only around 60 in 2006, when PRA was not a sponsor.  I'm sure you will be as impressed as I was to read what our efforts yielded, so I'm including a letter that Mark sent a few days after the clean-up.<BR>

To All Who Helped With Rock Creek Cleanup:
<P>
This past Saturday morning an army of friends and neighbors – more than 230! - devoted a lovely morning to clearing unsightly refuse from a 1.5 mile length of creek.  Working a total of nearly 400 hours, we removed some 200 bags of trash, including 50 bags of recyclables. Among the more peculiar items dragged  from the creek bed and environs were:
<P ALIGN="center">
<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="5" WIDTH="80%">

<I>* an entire bicycle<BR>
* a single-sized mattress<BR>
* chicken wire<BR>

    </TD>
    <TD>
<I>* the rusted remains of a discarded culvert<BR>
* a grocery cart<BR>
* construction debris<BR>
* car parts<BR>
* a toddler push toy<BR>
* 41 worn auto tires, many on rims</I>
  </TD>

</TABLE>
<P>
Estimated total weight: Over 3 tons<BR>
And now our valuable community asset, the park, is amazingly tidy.  It's fun to walk, jog or bike through the park again, and it's safer for the creatures that sleep, eat and dine there, too. Thank you for the back bending and bag toting, for the raking and digging, for dragging wheelbarrows and wagons and sleds loaded with trash that had somehow ended up where it never belonged.  It's good to know we live in a community that can come together and set things right.

<B><U><BIG>Be a responsible pet owner!</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
We have had an extensive exchange of messages on the PRA listserv recently regarding the death of a yorkie by an unleashed, unaccompanied dog.  This has upset many in the neighborhood, and follows on the heels of an incident reported last November when another small dog was attacked and seriously injured by an unleashed dog.  <I>Montgomery County requires dogs to be leashed.</I> Even if your dog is well behaved, having it off leash can result in unanticipated actions in the presence of other animals or people. Damage done by an uncontrolled animal can have tragic consequences for the victim as well as the owner of the attacking animal.
<P>
Thanks to Ann Melchior, the following is a list of the Montgomery County laws concerning dogs.  Since our dogs will be outside more, it’s important to keep these in mind:
<ul>
<li>Dogs must be leashed at all times when off the owner’s property (unless in a designated dog exercise area).</li>
<li>Owners must prevent unwelcome and threatening contact by their pet to others off the owner’s property.</li>
<li>Owners must scoop feces and DOUBLE BAG it in plastic before disposing in household trash.</li>
<li>Owners must vaccinate cats and dogs over 4 months of age for rabies.</li>
<li>Owners must license all cats and dogs over 4 months of age.</li>
<li>Owners must provide appropriate care.</li>
<li>Owners must not allow pet noise loud and persistent enough to disturb another’s quiet enjoyment.</li>
<li>Owners may not tether a dog to a stationary object under circumstances endangering the dog.</li>
<li>Tethering a dog is permitted on harness only and may not be done between 10pm and 6am.</li>
</ul>

<B><U><BIG>BRAC Update:</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
At the March PRA meeting, guest speaker Dennis Coleman, director of the Community Liaison Office at NIH, discussed the potential impact of the proposed move of Walter Reed Army Hospital operations to the Naval Medical Center. NIH is as concerned as we are about the impact BRAC will have on traffic, since it sits across the street from the Naval Medical Center. The intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Cedar Lane already is among the most congested in Montgomery County.  In addition, the present rate of carpooling at Navy is considerably less than at NIH, making the impact of additional employees at Navy more significant. Mr. Coleman pointed out that even though the State of Maryland has allocated funds for roads related to BRAC, the majority of the funds are earmarked for Harford County and expanding the Beltway.  The Gazette sent reporter Patrick Dunne to our meeting and his article appeared in the March 21st issue (see "Residents Concerned by BRAC Traffic").
<P>
Parkwood residents will once again have an opportunity to comment on this planned move when the Environmental Impact Statement is issued this summer. The EIS was originally scheduled to be issued at the beginning of June, but it has been delayed at least until August due to additional transportation analysis that NIH and Montgomery County insisted on. Once the EIS is issued, public comment meetings will be held, and individual residents as well as PRA as an association can submit comments. Those of you who do send comments on the EIS to the Navy are encouraged to also send copies to County Executive Isaiah Leggett, County Council President Marilyn Praisner, and Representative Chris Van Hollen. Under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Navy must address each public comment on the Walter Reed relocation. As has been discussed in many newspaper articles, the BRAC will have a profound effect on traffic in our area.
<P>
Recent news stories have described various conflicting proposals: that Walter Reed not be closed at a time when so many wounded are arriving, that the relocation be speeded up because so many wounded are arriving, and that the Environmental Impact process be abandoned. The last suggestion is unlikely to happen since it has been strongly opposed by the County Executive, the County Council and  Rep. Chris van Hollen.

<B><U><BIG>New Parkwood Parents Listserv / Group</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
The Parkwood Parents Group recently has been set up to collect and share information regarding parents and children in Parkwood.  We are trying to populate our database with referral information and need input from other parents.  We are looking for physicians (pediatricians, dentists, specialties, etc), babysitters, child care centers and other numbers you would like to share with neighbors.  For more information, go to:  <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ParkwoodParents">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ParkwoodParents</A> or email <A HREF="mailto:cathy.paparizos@yahoo.com">cathy.paparizos@yahoo.com</A>

<B><U><BIG>Experts address Montgomery Planning Board on Growth Policy Innovations:</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
The public is invited to join the Montgomery County Planning Board throughout the spring to hear a diverse slate of planning experts speak about ways to guide growth while maintaining a vibrant economy and protecting the county's unique natural resources. The <I>Growth Management Speaker</I> series will inform the Planning Board and staff as they update the county's key growth policy (also known as the <I>Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance</I>) which directs growth to areas with the right level of roads, schools and other public amenities. The growth policy will ultimately be reviewed and voted on  by  the County Council.
<P>
As Montgomery County emerges as an economic power center in the state, public officials and planners are working to retain high levels of service and our historically high quality of life.  The series hosts nationally known experts who will lend insight into such issues as balancing growth and public services; fostering high-quality communities; developing vibrant urban areas and creating pedestrian-friendly environments; among other subjects.

<P>
<B><I>A  reminder… when you post an e-mail on the listserv, you should include your e-mail address. This will make it
easier for members to reply directly to you when a reply is not necessary for the whole group. Parkwood residents are frequently helped by information from others when they ask for advice, but please refrain from sending a message that just says "thanks" to the whole listserv.  And to all of you, a big “thanks” for your cooperation!</I></B>
