<B><U><BIG>Power Outage Update from PEPCO:</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
Power outages continue to be a problem in the neigborhood, and we enlisted the help of Senator Grosfeld to prod PEPCO into looking at the frequencies and locations of these problems. Residents were
asked to report such problems so patterns and causes might be identified.  At the request of Senator Grosfeld, PEPCO provided outage histories for homes in the Parkwood and Rock Creek Palisades communities. The information below is based on two-year outage data on the Parkwood addresses that we provided to Senator Grosfeld, and she sent the information to PRA to share with the residents. Senator Grosfeld has been very helpful to PRA in helping us deal with both PEPCO and with the County regarding our tree problems.

<B><U><BIG>Update on trees:</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
On a related matter, PRA President Kira Lueders had collected information on trees in need of maintenance by the County which was sent to Guy Turenne, then in charge of tree maintenance for the County  (<FONT color="green">What dept? DPW?)</FONT>. Kira recently learned that Mr.Turenne has left, and also left no record at all of his dealings with PRA. As a result of this person's irresponsibility, we have had to start the process all over again. The new person in charge of trees is Brett Linkletter (<A HREF="mailto:brett.linkletter@montgomerycountymd.gov">brett.linkletter@montgomerycountymd.gov</A>). Kira has spoken to him and sent him the file of trees needing attention that we put together at the end of 2005, and he has promised to put Parkwood at the top of the list of actual tree trimming. This may not take place for a number of months, however.  Meanwhile, there are a good number of trees in our area that have large orange marks on them, indicating that some action has been taken. These trees have been identified by the County as trees that need to be cut down. Kira has checked many of them, and most do seem to have serious problems. However, if any of you see such trees and feel they should not be cut down, or if you just want an explanation of the reason they are to be cut, please contact Mr.Linkletter. The County is once again claiming a lack of money as an excuse not to promise us replacement trees for those to be removed. As is clear from the accounting of power outage problems provided by PEPCO, many of these are caused by County trees that have not been given the attention they need.

<B><U><BIG>Rock Creek Park Playground:</BIG></U></B><BR>
<P>
There are currently plans by the Park Service to move the Rock Creek Park playground equipment from the Southwest corner of the intersection of Cedar Lane and Beach Drive to the northeast corner due to the floodplain in the current location.  However, the bike path runs along the northeast [???] side of Beach Drive.  Moving the playground to the opposite corner requires users to cross Cedar Lane and Beach Drive both from the Parkwood neighborhood and from the bike path.  Currently, no cross walks or walk signals exist
on Beach Drive on the west side of Cedar Lane, or on Cedar Lane. These will be the sites of required pedestrian crossing through the intersection if the playground is indeed relocated.  Parkwood
resident Megan Brown submitted a request for crosswalks to the County DPWT last month, and is our PRA liaison for  updates on any action by the County. She has suggested that MCCPC staff could do a
presentation on the playground move at our Spring meeting if there is sufficient interest.
