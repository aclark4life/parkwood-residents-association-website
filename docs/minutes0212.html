<LI>Ann Root reported that the residents on Ashwood  would like the street to
be one-way, opposite in direction to Crestwood (the next road over).  It is a
very narrow street with cars parked on both sides.  Ann wrote a letter to start
the process with the Montgomery County Department of Transportation.  The
county sent back a petition and will comply with what the residents want.
<LI>Report on LCOR Development - White Flint area project that includes 8
buildings (4 apartment and 4 office).  Liz wrote a letter suggesting that they
slow down on this project until we see what the effect of the Grosvenor project
is on the community.  A resident raised opinion that the loss of green space in
the KPES project is more important than loss of recreational area in White
Flint area.  The resident noted that this White Flint development has been in
the master plan for a long time.
<LI>Report on Proposed Vehicle Registration Surcharge MC 303-03.  If passed,
the state can charge $11 for each vehicle and allows the county to set up
another charge that can be equal to the current registration fee.  The money
will go to two funds - The Maryland Emergency Medical System Operations Fund
and the "Go Montgomery!" Transportation Fund.
<LI>Report on Snow Removal.  There is a new law requiring sidewalks in front of
residences to be cleared within 24 hours after snow.  This was raised to
discuss if there is any way to help elderly neighbors.  One suggestion was to
generate a list of people who need the service and work with local organization
such as Boy Scouts.  Potential to earn required community service hours.  A
resident brought up problem of able neighbors who do not shovel.  A resident
volunteered that Channel 4 publicized a phone number that should be used to
report residents who don’t comply with the new law.

list of churches and synagogues in the packet.
<P>
<B>Block Captains</B><BR>
Kathy Byars discussed function of the block captains as distributing
newsletters and questioned addition of new job distributing welcome packets.
Liz Brennan suggested keeping this fluid as some block captains may not live on
the street they cover and wouldn’t know of new residents.  Kathy will put a
list of the block captains on the listserve.

Kensington town improvements such as pedestrian crossing on Connecticut Avenue;
Stricter animal control laws;  Better lighting in area of Beach Drive at
Grosvenor Lane and Rockville Pike;  Better warning to traffic about
pedestrian/bike crossing on Beach Drive past Connecticut; and Emergency
procedures for the community (post 9/11) and public awareness of procedures.

<LI>There was an attempted child abduction this fall.  It appears that this was
an isolated case and no further attempts have been reported.
<LI>A locked car (with an alarm system) was stolen from the neighborhood.  It
was suggested that residents use clubs with the club lock toward the dashboard
to prevent auto theft.  It was also suggested that residents leave front yard
lights on at night as a deterrent.
<LI>Regarding PRA newsletter information, a resident voiced an objection to Liz
testifying before the Park and Planning Commission about the proposed KPES
modernization and not mentioning it at the September meeting.  The resident
also believes Liz should have included that there was opposition to the
modernization.  Another resident pointed out that Liz, as the elected President
of the PRA, represents the organization as a whole, which passed a motion in
June to support the KPES modernization.
