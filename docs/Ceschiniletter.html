<P>
Dear Mr. Ceschini,
<P>
I am writing you at the encouragement of my fellow Parkwood
residents to bring an unfortunate occurrence to your attention. This
concerns unprofessional behavior on the part of Ms. Fran Beatty. As
documented in the enclosed e-mail exchanges I had with Ms. Beatty, I
invited the Kensington-Parkwood chorus to sing at the December
meeting of the Parkwood Residents Association by sending Ms. Beatty
an e-mail on September 26th. I clearly stated the event was to take
place at 7:30 pm on December 4th in the KPES all-purpose room. Her
reply on September 28th indicated she was confused about where that
was, and I sent an additional e-mail with an explanation.
<P>
I sent an e-mail on November 6th reminding her of the event, but she
was in Italy and evidently did not read that message. I sent another
e-mail on November 30th, again noting the location at KPES and the
7:30 time of the event. A few days later, a parent of a chorus member
e-mailed me asking where the chorus was to sing, because the school
had sent home a notiice saying the performance was at the Kensington
Library. I sent another e-mail to Ms. Beatty on December 3rd,
pointing out the error and once again telling her the event was to be
at KPES.
<P>
When members of the Parkwood Residents Association arrived for the
meeting at 7:30, we were astonished to discover that Ms. Beatty had
started the performance at 7:00, and the chorus members and parents
were preparing to leave. Evidently, she also did not provide the
cookies for the children that she had offered to bring. When I spoke
to her and expressed my dismay at what had occurred, she was barely
civil, and claimed she was tired and had no idea what the Parkwood
Residents Association was. I told her that the members were
disappointed to have missed the performance, and she said it didn’t
matter since there were plenty of chorus member’s parents present,
and she was quite happy with the performance.
<P>
The Parkwood Residents Association members would at least have
expected an apology from Ms. Beatty. We feel the lack of respect she
showed to the neighbors of KPES needs to be brought to your
attention.
<P>
                            Sincerely,<BR><BR><BR>


                            Kira Lueders, President PRA
