Dear Mr. Wroe:
<P>
Thank you for your guidance in our request for traffic calming in the Kensington-Parkwood neighborhood.  We are writing to request studies on the roadways specified below to identify appropriate measures to address excessive speed on high-volume sections.  These sections of roadways abut either Rock Creek Park (main pedestrian route for recreation and to the Metro) or the grounds of the Kensington-Parkwood Elementary School.
<ol type="1">
<li>Parkwood Drive<BR>
a. Section between Puller Drive and Saul Road.  High traffic volume and excessive speed between 7:30 – 8:30 a.m.<BR>
b. Section between Saul Road and Franklin Street.  High traffic volume and excessive speed between 7:30 – 8:30 a.m. given the limited visibility due to several visual obstacles.<BR>
c. Section between Franklin Street and Wildwood Road.  Excessive speed between 5:30 – 6:30 p.m. on section of roadway with no sidewalks.</li>
<li>Saul Road<BR>
d. Section between Parkwood Drive and Franklin Street.  High traffic volume and excessive speed during period when students are walking to school, between 7:50 – 8:50 a.m.<BR>
e. Section between Franklin Street and Thornwood Road.  Excessive speed between 5:30 – 6:30 p.m.</li>
<li>Franklin Street<BR>
f. Section between Beach Drive and Ashwood Road.  High traffic volume and excessive speed between 3:30 – 4:40 p.m.<BR>
g. Section between Edgefield Road and Cedar Lane.  Excessive speed between 7:30 – 8:30 a.m.</li>
</ol>
In addition, residents concerned with traffic and pedestrian safety brought the following intersections and sections of roadway to the attention of the PRA.  We forward these intersections as requests for traffic control/signage rather than traffic calming per se.  We are including these additional requests in this letter to facilitate coordination between any studies that will be conducted.
<ol type="1">
<li>Parkwood Drive and Franklin Street.  Entrance to Rock Creek Park for pedestrians and vehicles, one block from grounds of the Kensington-Parkwood Elementary School.  Four-way stop signs already present, but no crosswalks or sidewalks.  Crosswalks are requested at this intersection.</li>
<li>Everett Street between Thornwood Road and Cedar Lane.  One-way section of roadway where vehicles frequently enter for Thornwood Road and drive the wrong way to reach Cedar Lane.  Regular history of traffic accidents.  “One Way” sign is inadequate and additional signage (such as “Do Not Enter”) is requested.</li>
<li>Franklin Street and Wildwood Road.  Stop signs are requested due to excessive speed along both roadways at this intersection.</li>
<li>Saul Road and Wildwood Road.  Stop signs are requested due to excessive speed.  Please note that a request for stop signs at this intersection was forwarded from the PRA on March 19, 2006 to Thomas Poque as part of a Renew Montgomery Program request.  This request was assigned log # 070542 and was forwarded to Mr. Khursheed Bilgrami for investigation and response.</li>
<li>Southern intersection of Parkwood Drive and Parkwood Terrace.  Limited visibility due to visual obstacle posed by vehicles parking along the traffic island.  Signage to limit parking in sight line requested.</li>
<li>Cedar Lane and Beach Drive.  There are currently plans by the Park Service to move the Rock Creek Park playground equipment from the Southwest corner of this intersection to the Northeast corner due to the floodplain in the current location.  However, the bike path runs along the Northeast side of Beach Drive.  Moving the playground to the opposite corner requires users to cross Cedar Lane and Beach Drive both from the Parkwood-Kensington neighborhood and from the bike path.  Currently, no cross walks or walk signals exist on Beach Drive on the west side of Cedar Lane, or on Cedar Lane.  These will be the sites of required pedestrian crossing through the intersection if the playground is indeed relocated.  Please note that Parkwood resident Megan Brown submitted this request to the DPWT on October 12, 2006.</li>
</ol>
For the purposes of coordination with the PRA on action for traffic calming studies and proposed signage, I designate Lara Akinbami as the PRA contact.  Her contact information is below.  Please copy me on any correspondence.  Thank you for your time and assistance with this request.
<P>
Sincerely,<BR><BR><BR>
