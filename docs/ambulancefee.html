<P>
Dear Tom:
<P>
I am writing on behalf of the Parkwood Resident's Association to ask the Council not to support Bill 26-04 Fire and Rescure Service Emergency Medical Service Transport Fee.
<P>
The residents of Parkwood feel very strongly that this very basic and critical  service should continue to be supported by tax dollars. If you impose of fee of any sort the uninsured residents, those on fixed incomes or at the poverty level are sure to be adversely affected.
<P>
Mr. Duncan states that there are 2 major reasons for instituting this fee. The first, regarding the abuse of the system can be addressed through education. So often the Montgomery County government relies on education as a solution - this should be one of those times. The second is the critical need for funds for the aging and inadequate equipment. This is a capital expense and as we both know when Montgomery County really wants something - like Strathmore at 45 million + or the Montrose Parkway at 56 million + the funds are identified and allocated.
<P>
Passage of this bill will send the wrong message about what kind of place Montgomery County is to live. We sincerely hope that the council will not support this bill
<P>
Regards,
<P>
Liz Brennan
President, Parkwood Resident's Association

<P>
Thx for your note.  We will be reviewing the bill in the months ahead.  You have raised a number of important issues.  I have asked a number of questions about various aspects of the bill.  Other jurisdictions have put this in place, and so I would like to learn from them about their experiences.  As things move forward, I will be sure to keep you in the loop.
<P>
I have not met with CKC in awhile.  If there is an opportunity to check in and have a listening session after the new year, I would be glad to do it.  Let me know what works.
<P>
Take care and happy holidays
<P>
Tom
