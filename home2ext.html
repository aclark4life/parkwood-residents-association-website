New trees are being planted in early December, 2013, thanks to the efforts of the PRA Tree Committe. The Tree Committee has provided these
<A HREF="docs/TreeCare.html">recommendations for care for new trees</A>.
<P>
Thanks to the Tree Committee which in the end will have placed 77 percent of the requested plantings. The list of scheduled plantings can be viewed
<A HREF="docs/TreeSched.xls" target="_blank">here</A> (file in Excel 2003 format).
<P>
The Tree Committee has been working with Montgomery Country DOT for a mass tree planting in December 2013. They have been working in cooperation with neighbors to determine where trees need replacing and to coordinate with those who would like to have a street tree planted.

A special thank you to this committee for their time, expertise and energy.  These neighbors include Erin Haney who led/organized the committee and is coordinating the effort with the County; Kathy Byars, Jeff and Jan Griffith who surveyed and photographed stump locations throughout the neighborhood;  Pat Newman provided professional level work to summarize the characteristics, good and bad, of the trees available from the county; then Jan Rothman, Erin and Pat compiled the list of viable trees to best improve the overall PRA tree canopy into the future;  and the neighborhood survey team, which included Erin, Pat, Jan, Kathy, and Bailey and Gail Condrey, who went door to door distributing fliers to over 250 households, communicating the plan and responding to more than 100 neighbor requests, resulting in the PRA list of tree requests being submitted to the County.  Jeff Griffiths coordinated the huge flow of email requests and spreadsheet consolidations and acted as the Tree Committee technical support.

<B><U>Kensington Sector Plan</U></B> was approved by the County Council on Mar 20, 2012.
The community awaits the first site plan for development.  In the meantime various zoning changes are proposed that affect Kensington and surrounding communities.  Refer to the following resources for more information and to learn how to make your voice heard for items of interest to you:
<ul>
<li>Zoning text amendment (ZTA) legislation is proposed for a variety of issues that impact commercial property in Kensington.  You can view
<A HREF="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/csltmpl.asp?url=/content/council/leg/zta/index.asp" target="_blank">the entire list of ZTAs</A>.
Of particular interest to Kensington:
<ul>
<li>ZTA 12-06 proposes to remove transit proximity credits and parking credits for developers building near MARC train stations.  What is under discussion is whether all or some of the credit is removed.  This impacts every commercial property in Kensington.</li>
<li>ZTA 12-07 proposes to limit the distance between filling stations and residents.  This impacts the Costco gas station. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Accessory Apartments:  Legislation is being considered to change how Accessory Apartments are zoned, which impacts every household in Montgomery County.  This legislation is in its beginning stages of review on its way to the Planning Board.  You can learn more at
<A HREF="http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/functional/accessory_apartments.shtm" target="_blank">the Montgomery Planning site</A>.</li>
<li>Community organizations focused on land use and related issues:
<ul>
<li>The <A HREF="http://savekensington.com/" target="_blank">Committee to Save Kensington</A>, a group of residents from the Town of Kensington and ten surrounding neighborhoods, periodically holds informational sessions and communicates with residents topics of general interest related to the development of Kensington.  Included in this site are the facts about traffic mitigations (which are not included in the Kensington Sector Plan) and a proposed Summit Ave extension (which, if approved/funded, would not begin breaking ground until 2023 at the absolute earliest).</li>

<B><U>Tree Replanting in Parkwood</U> - </B>(Excerpted from an email from Bailey Condrey, PRA President)
<P>
Most of the trees being removed are maples and unfortunately we will lose many oaks.  Urban foresters have learned since many of these trees were planted, many 50+ years ago, that they succumb to disease, drought and pestilence, in urban settings.  The same species will not be replanted.
<P>
As with everything, this is not a perfect process, and it takes time.  There is no schedule of when and where they will be on specific dates.  The snowstorms we just experienced have probably placed an unbelievable work load on tree crews and the methodical process the county had developed for tree removal in Parkwood has been upset.  Only certain companies are allowed to work around power lines, Asplundh in the orange trucks is one of them.  They may be doing the power line tree work and leaving the remainder of the trees for other crews to finish, as a way for the county to reduce costs.  All of the trees with the orange dot on the trunk are slated for removal.  All of the stumps will be ground and a tree will be replanted for every one that is removed, unless a homeowner makes a specific request to forego a new tree.
<P>
Should you have questions regarding the county's tree replanting program please contact Larry Acosta at 240-777-6000.

<B><U>PEPCO</U> -</B> Representatives from PEPCO spoke at the PRA meeting Sept 19, 2005. They confirmed that people should contact PEPCO at the outage number, 1-877-PEPCO62, whenever their house is without power. Reports from a number of houses are helpful to them in pinpointing where the problem is. So don't just wait for your neighbor to call!
<P>
In addition, if power remains out, call again after 3 - 4 hours. Often they have fixed one problem in an area, and are not aware that some houses still remain without power.
